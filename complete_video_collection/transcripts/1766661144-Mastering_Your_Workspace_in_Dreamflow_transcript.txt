designed Dreamflow not only to provide
designed Dreamflow not only to provide
 
designed Dreamflow not only to provide
these three surfaces, but also to give
these three surfaces, but also to give
 
these three surfaces, but also to give
you the freedom to show and hide them
you the freedom to show and hide them
 
you the freedom to show and hide them
based on what you're working on. So,
based on what you're working on. So,
 
based on what you're working on. So,
let's jump in and check this out. So
let's jump in and check this out. So
 
let's jump in and check this out. So
when you jump into DreamFlow, you're
when you jump into DreamFlow, you're
 
when you jump into DreamFlow, you're
going to see something like this
going to see something like this
 
going to see something like this
interface right here. Now there are two
interface right here. Now there are two
 
interface right here. Now there are two
main ways to show and hide different
main ways to show and hide different
 
main ways to show and hide different
surfaces depending on what you need. So
surfaces depending on what you need. So
 
surfaces depending on what you need. So
the first way is up here with these
the first way is up here with these
 
the first way is up here with these
three options. So if I toggle this one,
three options. So if I toggle this one,
 
three options. So if I toggle this one,
this will show this module or widget
this will show this module or widget
 
this will show this module or widget
tree option over here. Now, if you have
tree option over here. Now, if you have
 
tree option over here. Now, if you have
other modules open like a Firebase or a
other modules open like a Firebase or a
 
other modules open like a Firebase or a
Superbase or your assets panel right
Superbase or your assets panel right
 
Superbase or your assets panel right
here, this will collapse that as well.
here, this will collapse that as well.
 
here, this will collapse that as well.
But most often, you're going to have
But most often, you're going to have
 
But most often, you're going to have
this widget tree panel open. Okay. The
this widget tree panel open. Okay. The
 
this widget tree panel open. Okay. The
second one is your properties panel. So,
second one is your properties panel. So,
 
second one is your properties panel. So,
this is contextual. So, whatever widget
this is contextual. So, whatever widget
 
this is contextual. So, whatever widget
you have selected, you'll see the
you have selected, you'll see the
 
you have selected, you'll see the
properties of that widget populate here.
properties of that widget populate here.
 
properties of that widget populate here.
And then finally, this third option, you
And then finally, this third option, you
 
And then finally, this third option, you
have your AI agent panel. Now to show or
have your AI agent panel. Now to show or
 
have your AI agent panel. Now to show or
hide these of course you can just click
hide these of course you can just click
 
hide these of course you can just click
these on or off. We also have shortcut
these on or off. We also have shortcut
 
these on or off. We also have shortcut
keys. So you have option two, three and
keys. So you have option two, three and
 
keys. So you have option two, three and
four to open and close these. So that's
four to open and close these. So that's
 
four to open and close these. So that's
the first way. The second way is to open
the first way. The second way is to open
 
the first way. The second way is to open
and close them with options within the
and close them with options within the
 
and close them with options within the
panel itself. So you've got these X
panel itself. So you've got these X
 
panel itself. So you've got these X
marks right here just as you would
marks right here just as you would
 
marks right here just as you would
expect. But also when they're closed you
expect. But also when they're closed you
 
expect. But also when they're closed you
can see that you've got these bars right
can see that you've got these bars right
 
can see that you've got these bars right
here that you can just click to open
here that you can just click to open
 
here that you can just click to open
them just like that. So if you want one
them just like that. So if you want one
 
them just like that. So if you want one
or two or all three open, you can just
or two or all three open, you can just
 
or two or all three open, you can just
toggle them however you want. Okay. So
toggle them however you want. Okay. So
 
toggle them however you want. Okay. So
those are the sort of two main ways to
those are the sort of two main ways to
 
those are the sort of two main ways to
manage your panels. But in this code
manage your panels. But in this code
 
manage your panels. But in this code
view right here, there's some additional
view right here, there's some additional
 
view right here, there's some additional
options you have. So right now I'm just
options you have. So right now I'm just
 
options you have. So right now I'm just
going to keep everything collapsed like
going to keep everything collapsed like
 
going to keep everything collapsed like
that. And I want to open up code view
that. And I want to open up code view
 
that. And I want to open up code view
right here. And you'll probably see
right here. And you'll probably see
 
right here. And you'll probably see
something like this. So you'll have your
something like this. So you'll have your
 
something like this. So you'll have your
files and folders, your file explorer
files and folders, your file explorer
 
files and folders, your file explorer
view right here, and then you'll have
view right here, and then you'll have
 
view right here, and then you'll have
the actual code of whatever file you
the actual code of whatever file you
 
the actual code of whatever file you
have open on the right. Now, I find
have open on the right. Now, I find
 
have open on the right. Now, I find
myself most often wanting to see a
myself most often wanting to see a
 
myself most often wanting to see a
preview of the app and my code at once.
preview of the app and my code at once.
 
preview of the app and my code at once.
And that's where this split option comes
And that's where this split option comes
 
And that's where this split option comes
in right here. That is, it's split
in right here. That is, it's split
 
in right here. That is, it's split
between my code view over here on the
between my code view over here on the
 
between my code view over here on the
left and the preview over here. Now, if
left and the preview over here. Now, if
 
left and the preview over here. Now, if
you want your preview on the left and
you want your preview on the left and
 
you want your preview on the left and
your code on the right, that's what this
your code on the right, that's what this
 
your code on the right, that's what this
button is here for. And so, you can just
button is here for. And so, you can just
 
button is here for. And so, you can just
swap those. Now, most of the time, what
swap those. Now, most of the time, what
 
swap those. Now, most of the time, what
you're going to want is the preview and
you're going to want is the preview and
 
you're going to want is the preview and
the actual code that you're going to be
the actual code that you're going to be
 
the actual code that you're going to be
working on most of the time, and then
working on most of the time, and then
 
working on most of the time, and then
you just switch between files. So, that
you just switch between files. So, that
 
you just switch between files. So, that
is to say, you don't need this visual
is to say, you don't need this visual
 
is to say, you don't need this visual
space of your file explorer. So, you can
space of your file explorer. So, you can
 
space of your file explorer. So, you can
just close that up right there. And
just close that up right there. And
 
just close that up right there. And
then, if you want to change the space
then, if you want to change the space
 
then, if you want to change the space
between these, you can just pull those.
between these, you can just pull those.
 
between these, you can just pull those.
And that works on any of these files. So
And that works on any of these files. So
 
And that works on any of these files. So
maybe I want to have my agent open. So
maybe I want to have my agent open. So
 
maybe I want to have my agent open. So
I've got my preview, I've got my code,
I've got my preview, I've got my code,
 
I've got my preview, I've got my code,
and then I've got my agent. And you can
and then I've got my agent. And you can
 
and then I've got my agent. And you can
adjust the difference like that. Okay.
adjust the difference like that. Okay.
 
adjust the difference like that. Okay.
So that's your code view. But remember,
So that's your code view. But remember,
 
So that's your code view. But remember,
when you're in this nested code view, so
when you're in this nested code view, so
 
when you're in this nested code view, so
you can have your code here. You can
you can have your code here. You can
 
you can have your code here. You can
have your split view. You can have your
have your split view. You can have your
 
have your split view. You can have your
files open up just like that. Of course,
files open up just like that. Of course,
 
files open up just like that. Of course,
you can combine that with any of these
you can combine that with any of these
 
you can combine that with any of these
up here. So if I open it up like that,
up here. So if I open it up like that,
 
up here. So if I open it up like that,
now I have my widget tree. Let's scale
now I have my widget tree. Let's scale
 
now I have my widget tree. Let's scale
this down so it's not budging up against
this down so it's not budging up against
 
this down so it's not budging up against
the edges. You can change the size of
the edges. You can change the size of
 
the edges. You can change the size of
your widget tree like that. Now, of
your widget tree like that. Now, of
 
your widget tree like that. Now, of
course, I'm having trouble seeing my
course, I'm having trouble seeing my
 
course, I'm having trouble seeing my
code right here. So, I can collapse my
code right here. So, I can collapse my
 
code right here. So, I can collapse my
file tree right there. And that works
file tree right there. And that works
 
file tree right there. And that works
great. So, that's how to manage your
great. So, that's how to manage your
 
great. So, that's how to manage your
workspace. So, you can make it efficient
workspace. So, you can make it efficient
 
workspace. So, you can make it efficient
and tailor it to whatever needs and
and tailor it to whatever needs and
 
and tailor it to whatever needs and
development styles you have. Let us know
development styles you have. Let us know
 
development styles you have. Let us know
if you have any questions and you can
if you have any questions and you can
 
if you have any questions and you can
submit feedback right here. So, if
submit feedback right here. So, if
 
submit feedback right here. So, if
there's a bug or a feature request or if
there's a bug or a feature request or if
 
there's a bug or a feature request or if
there's another style of working that
there's another style of working that
 
there's another style of working that
you would like to see in DreamFlow, we'd
you would like to see in DreamFlow, we'd
 
you would like to see in DreamFlow, we'd
love to hear from you and we'll see you
