Dreamflow just got an update. So let me
 
Dreamflow just got an update. So let me
show you some of the features. The first
show you some of the features. The first
 
show you some of the features. The first
one is Superbase edge functions. So now
one is Superbase edge functions. So now
 
one is Superbase edge functions. So now
you can write and deploy Superbase edge
you can write and deploy Superbase edge
 
you can write and deploy Superbase edge
functions right from Dreamflow. So let
functions right from Dreamflow. So let
 
functions right from Dreamflow. So let
me show you how this works. So I've
me show you how this works. So I've
 
me show you how this works. So I've
already got a Superbase project
already got a Superbase project
 
already got a Superbase project
connected here. And if I scroll down,
connected here. And if I scroll down,
 
connected here. And if I scroll down,
you can see I've got this edge functions
you can see I've got this edge functions
 
you can see I've got this edge functions
section. So I can come in and create an
section. So I can come in and create an
 
section. So I can come in and create an
edge function. And it's going to pop me
edge function. And it's going to pop me
 
edge function. And it's going to pop me
over to the agent because the agent has
over to the agent because the agent has
 
over to the agent because the agent has
these capabilities. And so it says,
these capabilities. And so it says,
 
these capabilities. And so it says,
"Please generate a superbase edge
"Please generate a superbase edge
 
"Please generate a superbase edge
function that is a proxy service for
function that is a proxy service for
 
function that is a proxy service for
open AI." Okay, great. So our agent has
open AI." Okay, great. So our agent has
 
open AI." Okay, great. So our agent has
written these Typescript files. If you
written these Typescript files. If you
 
written these Typescript files. If you
want to go see them, you can just click
want to go see them, you can just click
 
want to go see them, you can just click
into this view code right here and it'll
into this view code right here and it'll
 
into this view code right here and it'll
open up the actual function. And you can
open up the actual function. And you can
 
open up the actual function. And you can
see another great feature that we've
see another great feature that we've
 
see another great feature that we've
released is secrets. So the agent
released is secrets. So the agent
 
released is secrets. So the agent
recognized that we need some secure
recognized that we need some secure
 
recognized that we need some secure
secrets here like our open AI key
secrets here like our open AI key
 
secrets here like our open AI key
allowed origins and base URL. So it's
allowed origins and base URL. So it's
 
allowed origins and base URL. So it's
propagated this secrets feature right
propagated this secrets feature right
 
propagated this secrets feature right
here. So if I come in here and edit
here. So if I come in here and edit
 
here. So if I come in here and edit
this, let's put in our value and accept
this, let's put in our value and accept
 
this, let's put in our value and accept
it. Now that's deployed in Superbase.
it. Now that's deployed in Superbase.
 
it. Now that's deployed in Superbase.
Now our function isn't deployed yet. For
Now our function isn't deployed yet. For
 
Now our function isn't deployed yet. For
safety and security reasons, the agent
safety and security reasons, the agent
 
safety and security reasons, the agent
won't deploy these for you so that you
won't deploy these for you so that you
 
won't deploy these for you so that you
can review the code before you deploy.
can review the code before you deploy.
 
can review the code before you deploy.
Now, if you have multiple edge functions
Now, if you have multiple edge functions
 
Now, if you have multiple edge functions
here, you can deploy them individually
here, you can deploy them individually
 
here, you can deploy them individually
using this button right here, or deploy
using this button right here, or deploy
 
using this button right here, or deploy
all of them right here. Awesome. And now
all of them right here. Awesome. And now
 
all of them right here. Awesome. And now
that's deployed. And because your agent
that's deployed. And because your agent
 
that's deployed. And because your agent
knows about this, it'll be able to
knows about this, it'll be able to
 
knows about this, it'll be able to
design the architecture of your app
design the architecture of your app
 
design the architecture of your app
around these services that you've set
around these services that you've set
 
around these services that you've set
up. Next, we've increased the character
up. Next, we've increased the character
 
up. Next, we've increased the character
input max length to your agent. So,
input max length to your agent. So,
 
input max length to your agent. So,
previously it was at 10,000 characters.
previously it was at 10,000 characters.
 
previously it was at 10,000 characters.
Now, it's 50,000. This means that if
Now, it's 50,000. This means that if
 
Now, it's 50,000. This means that if
you've got a larger PRD or spec document
you've got a larger PRD or spec document
 
you've got a larger PRD or spec document
that you want to pass to your agent or
that you want to pass to your agent or
 
that you want to pass to your agent or
maybe pass some documentation for a
maybe pass some documentation for a
 
maybe pass some documentation for a
library that you're using, you're able
library that you're using, you're able
 
library that you're using, you're able
to add much greater context. So there's
to add much greater context. So there's
 
to add much greater context. So there's
this new package swift animations that I
this new package swift animations that I
 
this new package swift animations that I
wanted to use. But because it's a new
wanted to use. But because it's a new
 
wanted to use. But because it's a new
package, the agent had trouble
package, the agent had trouble
 
package, the agent had trouble
integrating it into my app. So instead,
integrating it into my app. So instead,
 
integrating it into my app. So instead,
I use this service get ingest to grab
I use this service get ingest to grab
 
I use this service get ingest to grab
the documentation. So then my agent was
the documentation. So then my agent was
 
the documentation. So then my agent was
better able to understand the API and
better able to understand the API and
 
better able to understand the API and
integrate it into my project. Finally,
integrate it into my project. Finally,
 
integrate it into my project. Finally,
the speed of the agent has drastically
the speed of the agent has drastically
 
the speed of the agent has drastically
improved. So, you should see much faster
improved. So, you should see much faster
 
improved. So, you should see much faster
performance with the same quality out of
performance with the same quality out of
 
performance with the same quality out of
the agent in Dreamflow. Those are the
