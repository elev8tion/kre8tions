00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
profile here. And I've got this image
 

49
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,549
profile here. And I've got this image
that I want to change the fit right

50
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
that I want to change the fit right
 

51
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,349
that I want to change the fit right
here. And down here I've got this new UI

52
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
here. And down here I've got this new UI
 

53
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,229
here. And down here I've got this new UI
that recognizes enums. And I want to

54
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
that recognizes enums. And I want to
 

55
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,469
that recognizes enums. And I want to
change it to cover. Yeah, that looks

56
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
change it to cover. Yeah, that looks
 

57
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,310
change it to cover. Yeah, that looks
better. Next, I want to make this image

58
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
better. Next, I want to make this image
 

59
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,109
better. Next, I want to make this image
a little bit bigger. So here I when I

60
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
a little bit bigger. So here I when I
 

61
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,870
a little bit bigger. So here I when I
hover over this property right here, you

62
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
hover over this property right here, you
 

63
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,030
hover over this property right here, you
can see I've got a couple of new options

64
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
can see I've got a couple of new options
 

65
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,670
can see I've got a couple of new options
right here. I can clear the value, set

66
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
right here. I can clear the value, set
 

67
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,469
right here. I can clear the value, set
it to infinity, or set it to a theme

68
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
it to infinity, or set it to a theme
 

69
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,390
it to infinity, or set it to a theme
variable. So when I bring that up, I

70
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
variable. So when I bring that up, I
 

71
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,550
variable. So when I bring that up, I
have all of my theme variables that are

72
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
have all of my theme variables that are
 

73
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,469
have all of my theme variables that are
coming from my theme module right here

74
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
coming from my theme module right here
 

75
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,950
coming from my theme module right here
that I can bind these to. Or if I want

76
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
that I can bind these to. Or if I want
 

77
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,310
that I can bind these to. Or if I want
to make this a little bit bigger, let's

78
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
to make this a little bit bigger, let's
 

79
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,789
to make this a little bit bigger, let's
just scrub a little bit. I think like

80
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
just scrub a little bit. I think like
 

81
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,350
just scrub a little bit. I think like
160 will be about good. Yeah, that's

82
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
160 will be about good. Yeah, that's
 

83
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,670
160 will be about good. Yeah, that's
good. And then I'll just copy this value

84
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
good. And then I'll just copy this value
 

85
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,990
good. And then I'll just copy this value
over right here. Okay, that's great. But

86
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
over right here. Okay, that's great. But
 

87
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,670
over right here. Okay, that's great. But
now that I'm looking at this, I realize

88
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
now that I'm looking at this, I realize
 

89
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,149
now that I'm looking at this, I realize
this is slightly overkill and we've got

90
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
this is slightly overkill and we've got
 

91
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,069
this is slightly overkill and we've got
a perfectly good widget for this, the

92
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
a perfectly good widget for this, the
 

93
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,749
a perfectly good widget for this, the
avatar widget. So, I'm actually going to

94
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
avatar widget. So, I'm actually going to
 

95
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,550
avatar widget. So, I'm actually going to
come up to my stack right here. And in

96
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
come up to my stack right here. And in
 

97
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,830
come up to my stack right here. And in
my list of widgets, I'm going to in my

98
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
my list of widgets, I'm going to in my
 

99
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,990
my list of widgets, I'm going to in my
new editor right here, I'm just going to

100
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
new editor right here, I'm just going to
 

101
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,389
new editor right here, I'm just going to
I want to switch up that clip oval right

102
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
I want to switch up that clip oval right
 

103
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,749
I want to switch up that clip oval right
here, change the clip oval with an

104
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
here, change the clip oval with an
 

105
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,950
here, change the clip oval with an
avatar widget. Now, sometimes this will

106
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
avatar widget. Now, sometimes this will
 

107
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,190
avatar widget. Now, sometimes this will
make the modification in line or if it's

108
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
make the modification in line or if it's
 

109
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,270
make the modification in line or if it's
a larger task, it will delegate it over

110
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
a larger task, it will delegate it over
 

111
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,430
a larger task, it will delegate it over
to the agent right here. Okay, great.

112
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
to the agent right here. Okay, great.
 

113
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,110
to the agent right here. Okay, great.
And there it did it. And it kept the

114
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
And there it did it. And it kept the
 

115
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,270
And there it did it. And it kept the
path, which is cool. Next, I want to

116
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
path, which is cool. Next, I want to
 

117
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,589

got some new conditional UI that's
 

155
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,309
got some new conditional UI that's
helpful. So, if we open up the code

156
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
helpful. So, if we open up the code
 

157
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,070
helpful. So, if we open up the code
right here, you can see that we've got a

158
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
right here, you can see that we've got a
 

159
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,990
right here, you can see that we've got a
terminary operator that we've got some

160
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
terminary operator that we've got some
 

161
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,309
terminary operator that we've got some
nice UI here for. So, we're checking for

162
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
nice UI here for. So, we're checking for
 

163
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,750
nice UI here for. So, we're checking for
the is positive value. And if it's true,

164
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
the is positive value. And if it's true,
 

165
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,229
the is positive value. And if it's true,
we come in here and we can select this

166
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
we come in here and we can select this
 

167
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,149
we come in here and we can select this
icon, which is another one of our new

168
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
icon, which is another one of our new
 

169
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,350
icon, which is another one of our new
UIs. And if it's false, we use this icon

170
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
UIs. And if it's false, we use this icon
 

171
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,270
UIs. And if it's false, we use this icon
right here. We also have this UI for

172
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
right here. We also have this UI for
 

173
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,430
right here. We also have this UI for
null coalesing operators. If you want to

174
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
null coalesing operators. If you want to
 

175
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,430
null coalesing operators. If you want to
introduce shadows, you have a new shadow

176
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
introduce shadows, you have a new shadow
 

177
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,830
introduce shadows, you have a new shadow
UI that allows us to add multiple

178
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
UI that allows us to add multiple
 

179
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,149
UI that allows us to add multiple
shadows. So if we come in here, we can

180
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
shadows. So if we come in here, we can
 

181
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,750
shadows. So if we come in here, we can
see that we've got a bunch of different

182
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
see that we've got a bunch of different
 

183
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,070
see that we've got a bunch of different
recently used shadows. And so if we

184
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
recently used shadows. And so if we
 

185
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,149
recently used shadows. And so if we
select one right here, you see that we

186
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
select one right here, you see that we
 

187
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,309
select one right here, you see that we
can stack multiple shadows on top of one

188
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
can stack multiple shadows on top of one
 

189
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,750
can stack multiple shadows on top of one
another, which makes for some really

190
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
another, which makes for some really
 

191
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,309
another, which makes for some really
elegant UI. Finally, we have new UI for

192
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
elegant UI. Finally, we have new UI for
 

193
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,949
elegant UI. Finally, we have new UI for
common modifiers like padding. So here

194
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
common modifiers like padding. So here
 

195
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,670
common modifiers like padding. So here
we can switch to symmetric or individual

196
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
we can switch to symmetric or individual
 

197
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,750
we can switch to symmetric or individual
or back to all if we want to add an

198
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
or back to all if we want to add an
 

199
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,149
or back to all if we want to add an
alignment. We've got a nice alignment UI

200
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
alignment. We've got a nice alignment UI
 

201
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,869
alignment. We've got a nice alignment UI
and expansion. Next, we've shipped a

202
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
and expansion. Next, we've shipped a
 

203
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,430
and expansion. Next, we've shipped a
whole new theme module. The new theme

204
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:53,440
whole new theme module. The new theme
 

205
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,550
whole new theme module. The new theme
module provides intelligent LLM powered

206
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
module provides intelligent LLM powered
 

207
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,869
module provides intelligent LLM powered
theme parsing. So this doesn't rely on

208
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
theme parsing. So this doesn't rely on
 

209
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,429
theme parsing. So this doesn't rely on
hard-coded patterns, but instead uses an

210
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
hard-coded patterns, but instead uses an
 

211
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,070
hard-coded patterns, but instead uses an
LLM to intelligently understand your

212
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
LLM to intelligently understand your
 

213
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,910
LLM to intelligently understand your
theme structure. This means it works

214
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
theme structure. This means it works
 

215
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,229
theme structure. This means it works
with standard material themes, custom

216
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
with standard material themes, custom
 

217
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,470
with standard material themes, custom
theme classes, and any other theme

218
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
theme classes, and any other theme
 

219
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,390
theme classes, and any other theme
organization pattern. So once it

220
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
organization pattern. So once it
 

221
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,149
organization pattern. So once it
understands it, you can visually edit

222
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
understands it, you can visually edit
 

223
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,789
understands it, you can visually edit
colors, typography, and style constants.

224
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
colors, typography, and style constants.
 

225
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,229
colors, typography, and style constants.
So let me show you how it works. To

226
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
So let me show you how it works. To
 

227
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,069
So let me show you how it works. To
access the new theme module, come over

228
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
access the new theme module, come over
 

229
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,310
access the new theme module, come over
here and click on this theme editor

230
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
here and click on this theme editor
 

231
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,310
here and click on this theme editor
right here. You can see all the theme

232
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
right here. You can see all the theme
 

233
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,390
right here. You can see all the theme
variables and their types populated.

234
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
variables and their types populated.
 

235
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,749
variables and their types populated.
Now, when you click into each one of

236
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
Now, when you click into each one of
 

237
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,430
Now, when you click into each one of
these values, you can see what it's

238
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
these values, you can see what it's
 

239
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,189
these values, you can see what it's
populated with. You can select the

240
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
populated with. You can select the
 

241
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,270

242
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
colors. You can change them. You can see
 

243
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,270
colors. You can change them. You can see
whether it's dark or light and you can

244
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
whether it's dark or light and you can
 

245
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,590
whether it's dark or light and you can
switch that here or switch that here and

246
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
switch that here or switch that here and
 

247
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,110
switch that here or switch that here and
it's synced with your app. So you can

248
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
it's synced with your app. So you can
 

249
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,030
it's synced with your app. So you can
see it in the context of the application

250
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
see it in the context of the application
 

251
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,430
see it in the context of the application
of your design. Now notice here that the

252
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
of your design. Now notice here that the
 

253
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,230
of your design. Now notice here that the
new theming system is type aware. So it

254
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
new theming system is type aware. So it
 

255
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,550
new theming system is type aware. So it
understands what's typography, what's

256
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
understands what's typography, what's
 

257
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,270
understands what's typography, what's
colors, padding values and much more.

258
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
colors, padding values and much more.
 

259
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,270
colors, padding values and much more.
And when you want to apply these values,

260
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
And when you want to apply these values,
 

261
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,110
And when you want to apply these values,
let's come in here. Let's wrap this with

262
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
let's come in here. Let's wrap this with
 

263
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,909
let's come in here. Let's wrap this with
padding. You can come into this value

264
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
padding. You can come into this value
 

265
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,390
padding. You can come into this value
right here and apply the value that you

266
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
right here and apply the value that you
 

267
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,390
right here and apply the value that you
want. Now, for this project, if you go

268
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
want. Now, for this project, if you go
 

269
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,070
want. Now, for this project, if you go
in and take a look at our theme, we have

270
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
in and take a look at our theme, we have
 

271
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,390
in and take a look at our theme, we have
all of our theming in one file. But this

272
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
all of our theming in one file. But this
 

273
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,790
all of our theming in one file. But this
theme module is intelligent. So, in this

274
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
theme module is intelligent. So, in this
 

275
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,390
theme module is intelligent. So, in this
project, I've got a different theme

276
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
project, I've got a different theme
 

277
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,230
project, I've got a different theme
architecture. So, if I look in here,

278
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
architecture. So, if I look in here,
 

279
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,070
architecture. So, if I look in here,
I've got a theme folder with different

280
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
I've got a theme folder with different
 

281
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,550
I've got a theme folder with different
files for colors, dark theme, light

282
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
files for colors, dark theme, light
 

283
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,870
files for colors, dark theme, light
theme, and typography. And when I come

284
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
theme, and typography. And when I come
 

285
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,550
theme, and typography. And when I come
in here, you can see that it's

286
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
in here, you can see that it's
 

287
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,310
in here, you can see that it's
recognized a structure, and it's able to

288
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
recognized a structure, and it's able to
 

289
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,390
recognized a structure, and it's able to
pull in all the values. And I'm able to

290
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
pull in all the values. And I'm able to
 

291
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,230
pull in all the values. And I'm able to
apply these values in the same way that

292
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
apply these values in the same way that
 

293
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,070
apply these values in the same way that
I would with any other structure.

294
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
I would with any other structure.
 

295
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,070
I would with any other structure.
Finally, we've made multiple updates to

296
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
Finally, we've made multiple updates to
 

297
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,990
Finally, we've made multiple updates to
our agent. Dreamflow now supports

298
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
our agent. Dreamflow now supports
 

299
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,270
our agent. Dreamflow now supports
agents.md rules. Agents.mmd has become

300
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
agents.md rules. Agents.mmd has become
 

301
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,510
agents.md rules. Agents.mmd has become
the industry standard model for

302
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
the industry standard model for
 

303
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,590
the industry standard model for
directing agents. It was created by a

304
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
directing agents. It was created by a
 

305
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,909
directing agents. It was created by a
collaboration between openai codecs,

306
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
collaboration between openai codecs,
 

307

00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
agents work on your project. It defines
 

321
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,790
agents work on your project. It defines
your codebases patterns, conventions,

322
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
your codebases patterns, conventions,
 

323
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,790

and architectural decisions in one
 

325
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,309
and architectural decisions in one
place, and the agent will follow them

326
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
place, and the agent will follow them
 

327
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,390
place, and the agent will follow them
when generating and modifying code.

328
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
when generating and modifying code.
 

329
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,670
when generating and modifying code.
Here's how you set it up. In order to

330
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
Here's how you set it up. In order to
 

331
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,670
Here's how you set it up. In order to
get started with agents.md, you can just

332
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
get started with agents.md, you can just
 

333
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,909
get started with agents.md, you can just
come down here to rules, and when I

334
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
come down here to rules, and when I
 

335
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,150
come down here to rules, and when I
select it here, I can autogenerate this

336
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
select it here, I can autogenerate this
 

337
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,990
select it here, I can autogenerate this
file. It'll ask the agent to generate

338
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
file. It'll ask the agent to generate
 

339
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,150
file. It'll ask the agent to generate
this and the agent will scan your

340
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
this and the agent will scan your
 

341
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,070
this and the agent will scan your
project to understand the codebase so

342
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
project to understand the codebase so
 

343
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,990
project to understand the codebase so
that it can intelligently compose this

344
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
that it can intelligently compose this
 

345
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,230
that it can intelligently compose this
file. Great. It's created this file. So,

346
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
file. Great. It's created this file. So,
 

347
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,309
file. Great. It's created this file. So,
let's open it up. We've got a project

348
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
let's open it up. We've got a project
 

349
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,110
let's open it up. We've got a project
overview, architectural patterns, and

350
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
overview, architectural patterns, and
 

351
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,990
overview, architectural patterns, and
let's see here. File structure, code

352
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
let's see here. File structure, code
 

353
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,749
let's see here. File structure, code
style. Yeah, this is great. This will

354
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
style. Yeah, this is great. This will
 

355
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,590
style. Yeah, this is great. This will
help your agent be much more consistent

356
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
help your agent be much more consistent
 

357
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,510
help your agent be much more consistent
and higher quality in its generations.

358
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
and higher quality in its generations.
 

359
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,150
and higher quality in its generations.
Also, we've added Gemini 3.0 Flash, a
