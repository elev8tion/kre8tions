00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,670

Let me show you how to use Dreamflow's

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:01,680
Let me show you how to use Dreamflow's
 

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,070
Let me show you how to use Dreamflow's
Git integration. First, we'll clone a

4
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,080
Git integration. First, we'll clone a
 

5
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,990
Git integration. First, we'll clone a
repository from a private repo on

6
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
repository from a private repo on
 

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,590
repository from a private repo on
GitHub. And then we'll walk through how

8
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
GitHub. And then we'll walk through how
 

9
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,589
GitHub. And then we'll walk through how
to push a DreamFlow project you've been

10
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
to push a DreamFlow project you've been
 

11
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,830
to push a DreamFlow project you've been
working on to a new GitHub repo. For

12
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:11,840
working on to a new GitHub repo. For
 

13
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,509
working on to a new GitHub repo. For
this tutorial, we'll be using GitHub,

14
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
this tutorial, we'll be using GitHub,
 

15
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,190
this tutorial, we'll be using GitHub,
but this will work with any Git provider

16
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
but this will work with any Git provider
 

17
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,430
but this will work with any Git provider
like GitLab or Bitbucket. Okay, let's

18
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
like GitLab or Bitbucket. Okay, let's
 

19
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,349
like GitLab or Bitbucket. Okay, let's
get started. So, to clone a repo, just

20
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
get started. So, to clone a repo, just
 

21
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,590
get started. So, to clone a repo, just
come over here to clone codebase. Now,

22
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
come over here to clone codebase. Now,
 

23
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,109
come over here to clone codebase. Now,
the repo I'm going to be using is the

24
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
the repo I'm going to be using is the
 

25
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,349
the repo I'm going to be using is the
Great Wondrous app that I forked from

26
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,359
Great Wondrous app that I forked from
 

27
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,830
Great Wondrous app that I forked from
GSK. So, give it a name. And now we're

28
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
GSK. So, give it a name. And now we're
 

29
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,070
GSK. So, give it a name. And now we're
going to go grab the repo URL and get

30
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
going to go grab the repo URL and get
 

31
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,470
going to go grab the repo URL and get
our access token. To get your URL, just

32
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
our access token. To get your URL, just
 

33
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,910
our access token. To get your URL, just
come over here to code and in the HTTPS

34
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,920
come over here to code and in the HTTPS
 

35
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,389
come over here to code and in the HTTPS
and just grab this. Let's paste that in.

36
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
and just grab this. Let's paste that in.
 

37
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,470
and just grab this. Let's paste that in.
And I'll get our access token. To get

38
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
And I'll get our access token. To get
 

39
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,190
And I'll get our access token. To get
that, come over to your profile and into

40
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
that, come over to your profile and into
 

41
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,350
that, come over to your profile and into
settings and scroll down on the bottom

42
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
settings and scroll down on the bottom
 

43
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,150
settings and scroll down on the bottom
left here to developer settings. Then go

44
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,160
left here to developer settings. Then go
 

45
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,150
left here to developer settings. Then go
to personal access tokens. And you can

46
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
to personal access tokens. And you can
 

47
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,389
to personal access tokens. And you can
use either fine grain or the classic

48
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
use either fine grain or the classic
 

49
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,389
use either fine grain or the classic
tokens. We've left a link to the

50
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
tokens. We've left a link to the
 

51
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,069
tokens. We've left a link to the
documentation below. We're just going to

52
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
documentation below. We're just going to
 

53
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,709
documentation below. We're just going to
do classic tokens. Then let's generate a

54
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
do classic tokens. Then let's generate a
 

55
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,110
do classic tokens. Then let's generate a
new token. Give it a name. Set your

56
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
new token. Give it a name. Set your
 

57
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,950
new token. Give it a name. Set your
expiration date. We'll just keep it at

58
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
expiration date. We'll just keep it at
 

59
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,109
expiration date. We'll just keep it at
the default. And select the scopes of

60
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
the default. And select the scopes of
 

61
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,789
the default. And select the scopes of
permission that DreamFlow will have

62
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
permission that DreamFlow will have
 

63
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,390
permission that DreamFlow will have
access to. You'll need to give it the

64
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
access to. You'll need to give it the
 

65
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,190
access to. You'll need to give it the
repo and workflow. Then you can scroll

66
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
repo and workflow. Then you can scroll
 

67
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,270
repo and workflow. Then you can scroll
down and generate the token. Keep in

68
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
down and generate the token. Keep in
 

69
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,030
down and generate the token. Keep in
mind that you only see this token once.

70
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
mind that you only see this token once.
 

71
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,550
mind that you only see this token once.
So copy it and then go back to

72
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
So copy it and then go back to
 

73
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,030
So copy it and then go back to
DreamFlow. Paste in your token and clone

74
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
DreamFlow. Paste in your token and clone
 

75
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,950
DreamFlow. Paste in your token and clone
your repository. Now, how long this will

76
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
your repository. Now, how long this will
 

77
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,469
your repository. Now, how long this will
take will depend on the size of the

78
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
take will depend on the size of the
 

79
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,070
take will depend on the size of the
project. So, just keep that in mind if

80
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
project. So, just keep that in mind if
 

81
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,070
project. So, just keep that in mind if
you've got a larger project. Beautiful.

82
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
you've got a larger project. Beautiful.
 

83
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,270
you've got a larger project. Beautiful.
Our app is loaded up and running. Okay,

84
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
Our app is loaded up and running. Okay,
 

85
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,950
Our app is loaded up and running. Okay,
let's go over to our source control

86
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
let's go over to our source control
 

87
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,870
let's go over to our source control
section here where we can see the

88
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
section here where we can see the
 

89
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,710
section here where we can see the
history of our commits, any current

90
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
history of our commits, any current
 

91
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,670
history of our commits, any current
changes, and controls for branches and

92
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
changes, and controls for branches and
 

93
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,710
changes, and controls for branches and
connections to our source. Okay, this is

94
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
connections to our source. Okay, this is
 

95
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,910
connections to our source. Okay, this is
looking good. So, let's make some

96
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
looking good. So, let's make some
 

97
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,830
looking good. So, let's make some
changes here. I want to increase the

98
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
changes here. I want to increase the
 

99
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,429
changes here. I want to increase the
size of this text. It's a little bit

100
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
size of this text. It's a little bit
 

101
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,590
size of this text. It's a little bit
small. So, I'm going to go in here and

102
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
small. So, I'm going to go in here and
 

103
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,069
small. So, I'm going to go in here and
doubleclick down through the widget tree

104
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
doubleclick down through the widget tree
 

105
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,749
doubleclick down through the widget tree
until I get to my component here. There

106
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
until I get to my component here. There
 

107
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,510
until I get to my component here. There
it is. And I'm just going to do a quick

108
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
it is. And I'm just going to do a quick
 

109
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,630
it is. And I'm just going to do a quick
edit right here. Command K. Increase the

110
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
edit right here. Command K. Increase the
 

111
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,149
edit right here. Command K. Increase the
size of the font.

112
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
size of the font.
 

113
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,910
size of the font.
Yeah, that's looking better. And you can

114
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
Yeah, that's looking better. And you can
 

115
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,229
Yeah, that's looking better. And you can
see changes are automatically tracked

116
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
see changes are automatically tracked
 

117
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,150
see changes are automatically tracked
here. So, when you're ready to commit,

118
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
here. So, when you're ready to commit,
 

119
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,830
here. So, when you're ready to commit,
you can write a commit message right

120
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
you can write a commit message right
 

121
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,990
you can write a commit message right
here. Or you can have the agent do it

122
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
here. Or you can have the agent do it
 

123
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,070
here. Or you can have the agent do it
simply by selecting this button right

124
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
simply by selecting this button right
 

125
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,630
simply by selecting this button right
here. adjust drop cap sizing for better

126
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
here. adjust drop cap sizing for better
 

127
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,790
here. adjust drop cap sizing for better
readability. Yeah, that makes sense. But

128
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
readability. Yeah, that makes sense. But
 

129
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,710
readability. Yeah, that makes sense. But
let's be a little bit cleaner with this

130
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
let's be a little bit cleaner with this
 

131
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,470
let's be a little bit cleaner with this
and instead of committing it straight to

132
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
and instead of committing it straight to
 

133
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,030
and instead of committing it straight to
main, let's open up a new branch here.

134
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
main, let's open up a new branch here.
 

135
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,150
main, let's open up a new branch here.
We're going to call this font legibility

136
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
We're going to call this font legibility
 

137
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,949
We're going to call this font legibility
and save. Now we've switched to this

138
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
and save. Now we've switched to this
 

139
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,030
and save. Now we've switched to this
branch right there. We can see and let's

140
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
branch right there. We can see and let's
 

141
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,430
branch right there. We can see and let's
commit and push these changes. Here we

142
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
commit and push these changes. Here we
 

143
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,190
commit and push these changes. Here we
can see our commits been added. But

144
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
can see our commits been added. But
 

145
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,630
can see our commits been added. But
let's jump over to GitHub and take a

146
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
let's jump over to GitHub and take a
 

147
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,390
let's jump over to GitHub and take a
look. You can do so by just clicking on

148
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
look. You can do so by just clicking on
 

149
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,910
look. You can do so by just clicking on
this right here. You can see we've got

150
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
this right here. You can see we've got
 

151
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,790
this right here. You can see we've got
our two branches. And if we select them,

152
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
our two branches. And if we select them,
 

153
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,949
our two branches. And if we select them,
you can see there's our commit we just

154
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959

resolved. And if you want to see what
 

179
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,229
resolved. And if you want to see what
branches are available to you, you can

180
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
branches are available to you, you can
 

181
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,630
branches are available to you, you can
go in this dropown here and refresh your

182
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
go in this dropown here and refresh your
 

183
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,309
go in this dropown here and refresh your
branches. Let's jump over to a new

184
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
branches. Let's jump over to a new
 

185
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,750
branches. Let's jump over to a new
project, one that we started in

186
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
project, one that we started in
 

187
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,509
project, one that we started in
DreamFlow, and see how we get it into

188
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
DreamFlow, and see how we get it into
 

189
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,110
DreamFlow, and see how we get it into
version control. So I've got this

190
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
version control. So I've got this
 

191
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,350
version control. So I've got this
dashboard app, and I want to hook it up

192
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
dashboard app, and I want to hook it up
 

193
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,990
dashboard app, and I want to hook it up
to version control here. So I want to

194
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
to version control here. So I want to
 

195
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,390
to version control here. So I want to
connect a repository, and I need the

196
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
connect a repository, and I need the
 

197
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,229
connect a repository, and I need the
same information as before. So let's go

198
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
same information as before. So let's go
 

199
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,149
same information as before. So let's go
set that up in GitHub. So let's come

200
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
set that up in GitHub. So let's come
 

201
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,710
set that up in GitHub. So let's come
over here to add a new repo. Choose an

202
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
over here to add a new repo. Choose an
 

203
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,509
over here to add a new repo. Choose an
owner, a repo name, and make sure to add

204
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
owner, a repo name, and make sure to add
 

205
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,910
owner, a repo name, and make sure to add
a read or a license. the repo can't be

206
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
a read or a license. the repo can't be
 

207
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,910
a read or a license. the repo can't be
empty. So, I'm going to add a readme

208
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
empty. So, I'm going to add a readme
 

209
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,990
empty. So, I'm going to add a readme
right here and create the repository.

210
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
right here and create the repository.
 

211
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,270
right here and create the repository.
Okay. Then we go through the same

212
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
Okay. Then we go through the same
 

213
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,430
Okay. Then we go through the same
process right here. So, I'm going to

214
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
process right here. So, I'm going to
 

215
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,309
process right here. So, I'm going to
grab the URL and paste in our access

216
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
grab the URL and paste in our access
 

217
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,869
grab the URL and paste in our access
token and connect. All right. Great. We

218
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
token and connect. All right. Great. We
 

219
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,190
token and connect. All right. Great. We
are connected now. So, let's make our

220
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
are connected now. So, let's make our
 

221
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,509
are connected now. So, let's make our
first commit. We'll use it with the AI

222
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
first commit. We'll use it with the AI
 

223
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,070
first commit. We'll use it with the AI
and push our changes. Okay. Next, let's

224
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
and push our changes. Okay. Next, let's
 

225
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,229
and push our changes. Okay. Next, let's
add a feature here. And we'll use one of

226
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
add a feature here. And we'll use one of
 

227
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,070
add a feature here. And we'll use one of
the features generated from the agent

228
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
the features generated from the agent
 

229
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,509
the features generated from the agent
already. So, we're going to add a

230
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
already. So, we're going to add a
 

231
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,670
already. So, we're going to add a
settings page. And you can see while the

232
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
settings page. And you can see while the
 

233
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,509
settings page. And you can see while the
agent is working, it's automatically

234
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
agent is working, it's automatically
 

235
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,830
agent is working, it's automatically
tracking changes. Okay, the agent is

236
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
tracking changes. Okay, the agent is
 

237
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,750
