00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,470

When people talk about AI coding tools,

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:02,480
When people talk about AI coding tools,
 

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,110
When people talk about AI coding tools,
they usually talk about one thing,

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,120
they usually talk about one thing,
 

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,470
they usually talk about one thing,
speed, rapid prototyping, vibe coding,

6
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
speed, rapid prototyping, vibe coding,
 

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,709
speed, rapid prototyping, vibe coding,
spinning up things in a flash. And sure,

8
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:10,719
spinning up things in a flash. And sure,
 

9
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,950
spinning up things in a flash. And sure,
that's part of it, but it's not all of

10
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
that's part of it, but it's not all of
 

11
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,950
that's part of it, but it's not all of
it, and it's not the most important

12
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
it, and it's not the most important
 

13
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,470
it, and it's not the most important
part. An AI agent is just another tool

14
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,480
part. An AI agent is just another tool
 

15
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,029
part. An AI agent is just another tool
in your tool belt, like a debugger or

16
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
in your tool belt, like a debugger or
 

17
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,349
in your tool belt, like a debugger or
autocomplete. And like any professional

18
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
autocomplete. And like any professional
 

19
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,470
autocomplete. And like any professional
tool, you need the skill to master it.

20
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
tool, you need the skill to master it.
 

21
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,150
tool, you need the skill to master it.
So, in this video, I'm going to show you

22
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
So, in this video, I'm going to show you
 

23
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,950
So, in this video, I'm going to show you
how to use Dreamflow to go beyond simple

24
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
how to use Dreamflow to go beyond simple
 

25
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,229
how to use Dreamflow to go beyond simple
prototypes. We're going to prompt

26
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
prototypes. We're going to prompt
 

27
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,870
prototypes. We're going to prompt
Dreamflow to set up real production

28
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
Dreamflow to set up real production
 

29
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,190
Dreamflow to set up real production
architectural patterns. I'll show you

30
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
architectural patterns. I'll show you
 

31
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,670
architectural patterns. I'll show you
how to prompt like an architect so you

32
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
how to prompt like an architect so you
 

33
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,150
how to prompt like an architect so you
can build code bases that will last.

34
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
can build code bases that will last.
 

35
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,630
can build code bases that will last.
Okay, so let's jump into DreamFlow here

36
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
Okay, so let's jump into DreamFlow here
 

37
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,950
Okay, so let's jump into DreamFlow here
and we're going to create a new project

38
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:46,960
and we're going to create a new project
 

39
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,709
and we're going to create a new project
right here. And it's just going to be a

40
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
right here. And it's just going to be a
 

41
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,310
right here. And it's just going to be a
habit tracker. So, we're just going to

42
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
habit tracker. So, we're just going to
 

43
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,110
habit tracker. So, we're just going to
call it habity.

44
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
call it habity.
 

45
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,790
call it habity.
Create project. And when you create a

46
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
Create project. And when you create a
 

47
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,549
Create project. And when you create a
project, we're just running Flutter

48
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
project, we're just running Flutter
 

49
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,110
project, we're just running Flutter
create under the hood to scaffold out a

50
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
create under the hood to scaffold out a
 

51
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,990
create under the hood to scaffold out a
basic app. Okay, so here's my scaffolded

52
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
basic app. Okay, so here's my scaffolded
 

53
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,549
basic app. Okay, so here's my scaffolded
out app. I've got my agent open over

54
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
out app. I've got my agent open over
 

55
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,230
out app. I've got my agent open over
here. Now, the main thing you want to do

56
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
here. Now, the main thing you want to do
 

57
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,230
here. Now, the main thing you want to do
when you're building with AI is you want

58
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
when you're building with AI is you want
 

59
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,270
when you're building with AI is you want
to work in small iterable and testable

60
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
to work in small iterable and testable
 

61
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,270
to work in small iterable and testable
steps. So, I'm going to just start out

62
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
steps. So, I'm going to just start out
 

63
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,109
steps. So, I'm going to just start out
by creating some of the files and

64
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
by creating some of the files and
 

65
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,109
by creating some of the files and
folders. So I'm going to say I would

66
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
folders. So I'm going to say I would
 

67
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,070
folders. So I'm going to say I would
like to create a habit tracker app using

68
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
like to create a habit tracker app using
 

69
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,149
like to create a habit tracker app using
layered architecture and provider for

70
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
layered architecture and provider for
 

71
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,630
layered architecture and provider for
state management. So I want the agent to

72
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
state management. So I want the agent to
 

73
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,390
state management. So I want the agent to
create the files and folders but don't

74
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
create the files and folders but don't
 

75
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,350
create the files and folders but don't
write any of the code yet. And then I've

76
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
write any of the code yet. And then I've
 

77
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,910
write any of the code yet. And then I've
got this architectural diagram that I'm

78
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
got this architectural diagram that I'm
 

79
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,870
got this architectural diagram that I'm
just going to paste in a real basic app

80
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
just going to paste in a real basic app
 

81
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,950
just going to paste in a real basic app
right there and send it off. Now, as

82
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
right there and send it off. Now, as
 

83
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,190
right there and send it off. Now, as
that's working, let's open up our code

84
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
that's working, let's open up our code
 

85
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,950
that's working, let's open up our code
view right here. And you can see that

86
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
view right here. And you can see that
 

87
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,109
view right here. And you can see that
it's building out all of these files,

88
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
it's building out all of these files,
 

89
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,830
it's building out all of these files,
but with no content in them. And that's

90
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
but with no content in them. And that's
 

91
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,670
but with no content in them. And that's
great. That's exactly what we want to

92
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
great. That's exactly what we want to
 

93
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,910
great. That's exactly what we want to
see. Okay, great. The agent is finished.

94
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
see. Okay, great. The agent is finished.
 

95
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,069
see. Okay, great. The agent is finished.
We get a summary of the project

96
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
We get a summary of the project
 

97
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,389
We get a summary of the project
structure, which is exactly what we

98
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
structure, which is exactly what we
 

99
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,350
structure, which is exactly what we
passed in. That's great. And we can see

100
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
passed in. That's great. And we can see
 

101
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,310
passed in. That's great. And we can see
all of our files and folders here. And

102
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
all of our files and folders here. And
 

103
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,309
all of our files and folders here. And
we can look into them and see that

104
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
we can look into them and see that
 

105
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,469
we can look into them and see that
they're not actually populated with any

106
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
they're not actually populated with any
 

107
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,470
they're not actually populated with any
code yet. That's great. I'm also going

108
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
code yet. That's great. I'm also going
 

109
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,070
code yet. That's great. I'm also going
to tell the model, I want you to add

110
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
to tell the model, I want you to add
 

111
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,830
to tell the model, I want you to add
these architectural decisions

112
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
these architectural decisions
 

113
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,030
these architectural decisions
in an architecture.md

114
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
in an architecture.md
 

115
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,510
in an architecture.md
file. And I'm doing this so that as I'm

116
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
file. And I'm doing this so that as I'm
 

117
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,670
file. And I'm doing this so that as I'm
working, it's always referencing the

118
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
working, it's always referencing the
 

119
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,990
working, it's always referencing the
architectural decisions that we've made.

120
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
architectural decisions that we've made.
 

121
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,229
architectural decisions that we've made.
Okay, great. The agent has created this

122
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
Okay, great. The agent has created this
 

123
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,270
Okay, great. The agent has created this
file. And if we go into it right here,

124
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
file. And if we go into it right here,
 

125
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,030
file. And if we go into it right here,
we can see it's going to be layered

126
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
we can see it's going to be layered
 

127
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,830
we can see it's going to be layered
architecture. We're using provider and

128
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
architecture. We're using provider and
 

129
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,150
architecture. We're using provider and
we've got some data regarding the file

130
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
we've got some data regarding the file
 

131
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,990
we've got some data regarding the file
structure. Okay, that's beautiful. So,

132
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
structure. Okay, that's beautiful. So,
 

133
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,910
structure. Okay, that's beautiful. So,
we've got this project set up and let's

134
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
we've got this project set up and let's
 

135
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,750
we've got this project set up and let's
say we wanted to build out another

136
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
say we wanted to build out another
 

137
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,910
say we wanted to build out another
feature. Now, of course, I could ask the

138
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
feature. Now, of course, I could ask the
 

139
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,070
feature. Now, of course, I could ask the
agent to do this or I can do some of the

140
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
agent to do this or I can do some of the
 

141
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,390
agent to do this or I can do some of the
work myself. So, let's say I want to add

142
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
work myself. So, let's say I want to add
 

143
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,750
work myself. So, let's say I want to add
a feature for a new motivational quote

144
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
a feature for a new motivational quote
 

145
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,309
a feature for a new motivational quote
each day. Well, first I would need to go

146
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
each day. Well, first I would need to go
 

147
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,149
each day. Well, first I would need to go
into my services to add a quote service.

148
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
into my services to add a quote service.
 

149
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,990
into my services to add a quote service.
So, I can just go into here and I can

150
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
So, I can just go into here and I can
 

151
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,670
So, I can just go into here and I can
rightclick on service. I'm going to add

152
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
rightclick on service. I'm going to add
 

153
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,550
rightclick on service. I'm going to add
a file right here and I'm going to call

154
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
a file right here and I'm going to call
 

155
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,149
a file right here and I'm going to call
it quote service.dart. Then I'm going to

156
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
it quote service.dart. Then I'm going to
 

157
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,390
it quote service.dart. Then I'm going to
need a provider for that. So let's add a

158
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
need a provider for that. So let's add a
 

159
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,990
need a provider for that. So let's add a
file here for our quote provider.

160
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
file here for our quote provider.
 

161
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,390
file here for our quote provider.
And finally a widget for this. And I'll

162
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
And finally a widget for this. And I'll
 

163
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,990
And finally a widget for this. And I'll
just do the same thing. Daily quote

164
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
just do the same thing. Daily quote
 

165
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,229
just do the same thing. Daily quote
card. Now obviously the next step I

166
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
card. Now obviously the next step I
 

167
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,149
card. Now obviously the next step I
would want to go into my main.dart and

168
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
would want to go into my main.dart and
 

169
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,390
would want to go into my main.dart and
add this to the multi-provider. I would

170
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
add this to the multi-provider. I would
 

171
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,550
add this to the multi-provider. I would
need to add that new widget on our home

172
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
need to add that new widget on our home
 

173
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,550
need to add that new widget on our home
screen. But you can see the pattern of

174
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
screen. But you can see the pattern of
 

175
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,789
screen. But you can see the pattern of
how we would build here in a way that's

176
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
how we would build here in a way that's
 

177
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,949
how we would build here in a way that's
scalable and maintainable. Not just

178
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
scalable and maintainable. Not just
 

179
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,710
scalable and maintainable. Not just
passing off one prompt to build the

180
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
passing off one prompt to build the
 

181
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,550
passing off one prompt to build the
whole app. So let's take another example

182
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
whole app. So let's take another example
 

183
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,789
whole app. So let's take another example
and this time let's do a slightly more

184
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
and this time let's do a slightly more
 

185
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,110
and this time let's do a slightly more
complex architecture and slightly more

186
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
complex architecture and slightly more
 

187
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,190
complex architecture and slightly more
opinionated decisions here. So we're

188
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
opinionated decisions here. So we're
 

189
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,550
opinionated decisions here. So we're
going to do another habit tracker and

190
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
going to do another habit tracker and
 

191
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,869
going to do another habit tracker and
it's going to be habit complex. Let's

192
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
it's going to be habit complex. Let's
 

193
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,750
it's going to be habit complex. Let's
create that project.

194
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
create that project.
 

195
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,110
create that project.
Okay. So for this app I'm going to say I

196
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
Okay. So for this app I'm going to say I
 

197
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,030
Okay. So for this app I'm going to say I
want to build a habit tracker using

198
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
want to build a habit tracker using
 

199
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,710
want to build a habit tracker using
featurebased architecture. I'm going to

200
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
featurebased architecture. I'm going to
 

201
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,990
featurebased architecture. I'm going to
use riverpod for state management. Go

202
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
use riverpod for state management. Go
 

203
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,830
use riverpod for state management. Go

204
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
router for routing. Do for networking.

215
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,350

I don't want you to write any of the

216
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
I don't want you to write any of the
 

217
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,430
I don't want you to write any of the
code, just create the files and folders

218
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
code, just create the files and folders
 

219
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,510
code, just create the files and folders
and add dependencies to the pubspec.

220
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
and add dependencies to the pubspec.
 

221
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,350
and add dependencies to the pubspec.
Okay, great. Now, let's just add the

222
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
Okay, great. Now, let's just add the
 

223
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,110
Okay, great. Now, let's just add the
architectural diagram and send it off.

224
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
architectural diagram and send it off.
 

225
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,390
architectural diagram and send it off.
There we go. Adding all the

226
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
There we go. Adding all the
 

227
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,230
There we go. Adding all the
dependencies. That looks great. Checking

228
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
dependencies. That looks great. Checking
 

229
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,790
dependencies. That looks great. Checking
the pubspec. Okay, that's great. Let's

230
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800

231
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,710
the pubspec. Okay, that's great. Let's
check out the file structure. We've got

232
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
check out the file structure. We've got
 

233
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,189
check out the file structure. We've got
our features, just one feature for now.

237
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,830
Our posts with our three layers right
here. That looks beautiful. Now, if I

238
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
here. That looks beautiful. Now, if I
 

239
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,270
here. That looks beautiful. Now, if I
were to continue working on this

240
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
were to continue working on this
 

241
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,110
were to continue working on this
project, I would probably delegate the

242
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
project, I would probably delegate the
 

243
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,990
project, I would probably delegate the
agent to configuring the basic routing,

244
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
agent to configuring the basic routing,
 

245
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,150
agent to configuring the basic routing,
setting up provider scope, then maybe I

246
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
setting up provider scope, then maybe I
 

247
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,990
setting up provider scope, then maybe I
would focus on the domain layer of our

248
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
would focus on the domain layer of our
 

249
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,150
would focus on the domain layer of our
first feature habits. And once again,

250
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
first feature habits. And once again,
 

251
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,870
first feature habits. And once again,
the idea is working in small, iterative,

252
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
the idea is working in small, iterative,
 

253
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,990
the idea is working in small, iterative,
and testable steps. So the big idea is

254
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
and testable steps. So the big idea is
 

255
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,230
and testable steps. So the big idea is
that by prompting Dreamflow with

256
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
that by prompting Dreamflow with
 

257
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,469
that by prompting Dreamflow with
specific architectural patterns and

258
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
specific architectural patterns and
 

259
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,430
specific architectural patterns and
libraries, we've laid the groundwork for

260
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
libraries, we've laid the groundwork for
 

261
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,390
libraries, we've laid the groundwork for
maintainable production applications,

262
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
maintainable production applications,
 

263
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,710
maintainable production applications,
not just throwaway prototypes. This

264
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
not just throwaway prototypes. This
 

265
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,430
not just throwaway prototypes. This
isn't vibe coding and it isn't magic.

266
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
isn't vibe coding and it isn't magic.
 

267
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,870
isn't vibe coding and it isn't magic.
These are powerful force multipliers,

268
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
These are powerful force multipliers,

architecturally aware prompt gets you a
professional codebase. And this

fundamentally elevates your role. You
spend less time on the tedious setup and

from just knowing how to code to knowing
 

291
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,070
from just knowing how to code to knowing
how to communicate a complex system. So

292
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
how to communicate a complex system. So
 

293
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,390
how to communicate a complex system. So
remember this process. Think like an
