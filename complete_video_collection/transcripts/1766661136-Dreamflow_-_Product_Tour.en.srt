code itself. So, let me give you a tour.

14
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
code itself. So, let me give you a tour.
 

15
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,910
code itself. So, let me give you a tour.
Let's start with a prompt. Let's build a

16
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
Let's start with a prompt. Let's build a
 

17
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,870
Let's start with a prompt. Let's build a
habit tracker. The first thing Dreamflow

18
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
habit tracker. The first thing Dreamflow
 

19
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,029
habit tracker. The first thing Dreamflow
is going to do is formulate a plan that

20
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
is going to do is formulate a plan that
 

21
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,950
is going to do is formulate a plan that
you can see over here on the left. On

22
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
you can see over here on the left. On
 

23
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,150
you can see over here on the left. On
the right, you're going to see the

24
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
the right, you're going to see the
 

25
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,870
the right, you're going to see the
execution of that plan, including each

26
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
execution of that plan, including each
 

27
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,870
execution of that plan, including each
of the tasks it's going to accomplish,

28
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
of the tasks it's going to accomplish,
 

29
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,950
of the tasks it's going to accomplish,
the files it's going to edit, and the

30
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
the files it's going to edit, and the
 

31
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,190
the files it's going to edit, and the
diffs that you can expand to see what

32
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
diffs that you can expand to see what
 

33
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,870
diffs that you can expand to see what
it's actually doing. Additionally,

34
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
it's actually doing. Additionally,
 

35
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,950
it's actually doing. Additionally,
you'll see any of the packages that it

36
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
you'll see any of the packages that it
 

37
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,430
you'll see any of the packages that it
adds, and all of the classes that it's

38
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
adds, and all of the classes that it's
 

39
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,590
adds, and all of the classes that it's
writing. After it writes these files,

40
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
writing. After it writes these files,
 

41
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,910
writing. After it writes these files,
you can click into this view generated

42
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
you can click into this view generated
 

43
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,470
you can click into this view generated
files and select any file you want and

44
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,480
files and select any file you want and
 

45
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,069
files and select any file you want and
see all the code that's written. When

46
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
see all the code that's written. When
 

47
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,830
see all the code that's written. When
the task is completed, you'll see that

48
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
the task is completed, you'll see that
 

49
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,229
the task is completed, you'll see that
DreamFlow checks it off. And if you have

50
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
DreamFlow checks it off. And if you have
 

51
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,549
DreamFlow checks it off. And if you have
some extra time, you can play Asteroids.

52
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:58,559
some extra time, you can play Asteroids.
 

53
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,549
some extra time, you can play Asteroids.
All right, let's go back and view our

54
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
All right, let's go back and view our
 

55
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,630
All right, let's go back and view our
progress. And let's close out these

56
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
progress. And let's close out these
 

57
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,630
progress. And let's close out these
messages right here. And you can see

58
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
messages right here. And you can see
 

59
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,630
messages right here. And you can see
that we're almost done. As it's writing

60
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
that we're almost done. As it's writing
 

61
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,630
that we're almost done. As it's writing
the code, it will compile it and check

62
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
the code, it will compile it and check
 

63
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,030
the code, it will compile it and check
for errors. And if there are any errors,

64
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
for errors. And if there are any errors,
 

65
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,270
for errors. And if there are any errors,
it will fix them. All right, it's done.

66
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
it will fix them. All right, it's done.
 

67
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,750
it will fix them. All right, it's done.
So now it's opening it in DreamFlow. And

68
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:15,760
So now it's opening it in DreamFlow. And
 

69
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,310
So now it's opening it in DreamFlow. And
beautiful. Here's our app. Now, let's

70
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
beautiful. Here's our app. Now, let's
 

71
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,990
beautiful. Here's our app. Now, let's
get a little accustomed to this

72
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
get a little accustomed to this
 

73
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,550
get a little accustomed to this
interface. Now up here you can see a

74
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
interface. Now up here you can see a
 

75
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,630
interface. Now up here you can see a
couple of different options. And this

76
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
couple of different options. And this
 

77
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,350
couple of different options. And this
left one over here when I select it will

78
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
left one over here when I select it will
 

79
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,670
left one over here when I select it will
be my widget tree. So you can see all

80
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
be my widget tree. So you can see all
 

81
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,789
be my widget tree. So you can see all
the widgets on your page. Next over here

82
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
the widgets on your page. Next over here
 

83
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,749
the widgets on your page. Next over here
we have our properties panel. Now we

84
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
we have our properties panel. Now we
 

85
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,590
we have our properties panel. Now we
don't see anything right now because we

86
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
don't see anything right now because we
 

87
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,590
don't see anything right now because we
don't have any widgets selected. So we

88
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
don't have any widgets selected. So we
 

89
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,350
don't have any widgets selected. So we
can't see any widgets. But this is

90
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
can't see any widgets. But this is
 

91
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,429
can't see any widgets. But this is
getting a little bit cramped right here.

92
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
getting a little bit cramped right here.
 

93
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,069
getting a little bit cramped right here.
So I could shrink it down. But actually

94
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
So I could shrink it down. But actually
 

95
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,550
So I could shrink it down. But actually
I'm just going to close this agent panel

96
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
I'm just going to close this agent panel
 

97
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,149
I'm just going to close this agent panel
right here. And that's this third

98
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
right here. And that's this third
 

99
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,830
right here. And that's this third
option. There we go. That's feeling

100
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
option. There we go. That's feeling
 

101
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,149
option. There we go. That's feeling
better. The last main section is right

102
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
better. The last main section is right
 

103
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,950
better. The last main section is right
here. A preview of our app. Well, it's

104
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
here. A preview of our app. Well, it's
 

105
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,429
here. A preview of our app. Well, it's
actually the app itself. This is the

106
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
actually the app itself. This is the
 

107
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,749
actually the app itself. This is the
complete running version of your app.

108
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
complete running version of your app.
 

109
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,550
complete running version of your app.
Okay. So, let's make some changes here.

110
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
Okay. So, let's make some changes here.
 

111
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,469
Okay. So, let's make some changes here.
So, the first thing I want to do is I

112
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
So, the first thing I want to do is I
 

113
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,389
So, the first thing I want to do is I
want to change this title right here.

114
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
want to change this title right here.
 

115
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,190
want to change this title right here.
Now, I could click through right here

116
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
Now, I could click through right here
 

117
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,390
Now, I could click through right here
and try to figure out where this is, but

118
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
and try to figure out where this is, but
 

119
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,910
and try to figure out where this is, but
there's an easier way to do it, and

120
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
there's an easier way to do it, and
 

121
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,470
there's an easier way to do it, and
that's to turn on inspect mode right

122
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
that's to turn on inspect mode right
 

123
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,630
that's to turn on inspect mode right
here. And that allows me to hover over

124
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
here. And that allows me to hover over
 

125
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,949
here. And that allows me to hover over
and select whatever widget I want to

126
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
and select whatever widget I want to
 

127
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,510
and select whatever widget I want to
change. So, we want this text widget

128
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
change. So, we want this text widget
 

129
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,350
change. So, we want this text widget
right here. And when I select that

130
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
right here. And when I select that
 

131
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,869
right here. And when I select that
widget, you can see all of the

132
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
widget, you can see all of the
 

133
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,430
widget, you can see all of the
properties populating over here. And you

134
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
properties populating over here. And you
 

135
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,910
properties populating over here. And you
can just go in and change them. So, I

136
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
can just go in and change them. So, I
 

137
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,670
can just go in and change them. So, I
want this to be keystone tracker. Okay,

138
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
want this to be keystone tracker. Okay,
 

139
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,150
want this to be keystone tracker. Okay,
that's great. Next, this is a little bit

140
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
that's great. Next, this is a little bit
 

141
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,550
that's great. Next, this is a little bit
too big. And you can see this style is

142
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
too big. And you can see this style is
 

143
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,910
too big. And you can see this style is
coming from this headline small. That is

144
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
coming from this headline small. That is
 

145
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,910
coming from this headline small. That is
from our theme settings that you can

146
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
from our theme settings that you can
 

147
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,030
from our theme settings that you can
edit in this second tab right here. So,

148
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
edit in this second tab right here. So,
 

149
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,830
edit in this second tab right here. So,
that's headline small right over here.

150
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
that's headline small right over here.
 

151
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,229
that's headline small right over here.
And I'm just going to bump that down.

152
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
And I'm just going to bump that down.
 

153
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,830
And I'm just going to bump that down.
Yeah, that's looking better. I've got

154
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
Yeah, that's looking better. I've got
 

155
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,630
Yeah, that's looking better. I've got
another app here. It's a to-do app. And

156
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
another app here. It's a to-do app. And
 

157
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,710
another app here. It's a to-do app. And
if you notice, I've got this error right

158
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
if you notice, I've got this error right
 

159
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,949
if you notice, I've got this error right
here. It's an overflow error. and I want

160
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
here. It's an overflow error. and I want
 

161
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,270
here. It's an overflow error. and I want
to fix that with our agent. So, I'm

162
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
to fix that with our agent. So, I'm
 

163
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,430
to fix that with our agent. So, I'm
going to toggle our agent chat right

164
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
going to toggle our agent chat right
 

165
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,830
going to toggle our agent chat right
here. And there are various ways that

166
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
here. And there are various ways that
 

167
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,149
here. And there are various ways that
you can deal with debugging issues like

168
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
you can deal with debugging issues like
 

169
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,229
you can deal with debugging issues like
this. But for this one, I'm going to go

170
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
this. But for this one, I'm going to go
 

171
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,030
this. But for this one, I'm going to go
down here and take a screenshot and add

172
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
down here and take a screenshot and add
 

173
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,350
down here and take a screenshot and add
that to the agent context right there

174
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
that to the agent context right there
 

175
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,509
that to the agent context right there
and say in the tab bar there's an

176
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
and say in the tab bar there's an
 

177
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,229
and say in the tab bar there's an
overflow error. Please fix. Awesome. And

178
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
overflow error. Please fix. Awesome. And
 

179
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,949
overflow error. Please fix. Awesome. And
that is fixed. and our agent gives us a

180
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
that is fixed. and our agent gives us a
 

181
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,710
that is fixed. and our agent gives us a
nice summary of the tasks that it's

182
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
nice summary of the tasks that it's
 

183
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,550
nice summary of the tasks that it's
taken to fix it. The next thing I want

184
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
taken to fix it. The next thing I want
 

185
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,270
taken to fix it. The next thing I want
to do is I want to connect this to a

186
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
to do is I want to connect this to a
 

187
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,910
to do is I want to connect this to a
backend service and we have native

188
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
backend service and we have native
 

189
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,030
backend service and we have native
modules for Superbase and Firebase. Of

190
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
modules for Superbase and Firebase. Of
 

191
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,030
modules for Superbase and Firebase. Of
course, you have full access to the

192
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
course, you have full access to the
 

193
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,350
course, you have full access to the
code. So, you could use any backend you

194
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
code. So, you could use any backend you
 

195
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,990
code. So, you could use any backend you
want, but let's use Superbase. So, let's

196
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
want, but let's use Superbase. So, let's
 

197
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,309
want, but let's use Superbase. So, let's
come over here to our Superbase module

198
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
come over here to our Superbase module
 

199
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,070
come over here to our Superbase module
and connect to Superbase. This will

200
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
and connect to Superbase. This will
 

201
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,110
and connect to Superbase. This will
bring you through the OOTH flow and then

202
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
bring you through the OOTH flow and then
 

203
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,429
bring you through the OOTH flow and then
set up your project in Superbase. Great.

204
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
set up your project in Superbase. Great.
 

205
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,750
set up your project in Superbase. Great.
The project is set up. Now, let's have

206
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
The project is set up. Now, let's have
 

207
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,390
The project is set up. Now, let's have
the agent generate the client side code.

208
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
the agent generate the client side code.
 

209
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,630
the agent generate the client side code.
And you can see it's added to the thread

210
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
And you can see it's added to the thread
 

211
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,390
And you can see it's added to the thread
right here, and it's planning its

212
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
right here, and it's planning its
 

213
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,630
right here, and it's planning its
execution. Now, what's great here is

214
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
execution. Now, what's great here is
 

215
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,630
execution. Now, what's great here is
that because the agent has a context of

216
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
that because the agent has a context of
 

217
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,789
that because the agent has a context of
your entire app, it sees that it's a

218
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
your entire app, it sees that it's a
 

219
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,349
your entire app, it sees that it's a
to-do list. So, it's creating the tables

220
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
to-do list. So, it's creating the tables
 

221
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,150
to-do list. So, it's creating the tables
that make sense for a to-do app. Great,

222
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
that make sense for a to-do app. Great,
 

223
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,230
that make sense for a to-do app. Great,
it's finished. We've got a summary of

224
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
it's finished. We've got a summary of
 

225
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,830
it's finished. We've got a summary of
all the tasks that it took. Now, the

226
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
all the tasks that it took. Now, the
 

227
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,230
all the tasks that it took. Now, the
last step is to deploy these schema

228
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
last step is to deploy these schema
 

229
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,390
last step is to deploy these schema
changes. Now what's this doing is that

230
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
changes. Now what's this doing is that
 

231
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,710
changes. Now what's this doing is that
it wrote all the SQL to create the

232
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
it wrote all the SQL to create the
 

233
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,189
it wrote all the SQL to create the
tables and the rowle security and now

234
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
tables and the rowle security and now
 

235
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,790
tables and the rowle security and now
it's just executing those. All right,

236
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
it's just executing those. All right,
 

237
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,629
it's just executing those. All right,
that's all looking good. I can see here

238
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
that's all looking good. I can see here
 

239
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,590
that's all looking good. I can see here
in Superbase that I've got my to-dos and

240
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600
in Superbase that I've got my to-dos and
 

241
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,510
in Superbase that I've got my to-dos and
all the other things and the all and all

242
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
all the other things and the all and all
 

243
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,030
all the other things and the all and all
the other tables. But when I go back to

244
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
the other tables. But when I go back to
 

245
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,350
the other tables. But when I go back to
the app, I'm not seeing anything. And

246
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
the app, I'm not seeing anything. And
 

247
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,790
the app, I'm not seeing anything. And
that's probably because I'm not

248
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
that's probably because I'm not
 

249
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,189
that's probably because I'm not
authenticated as any user. So let's

250
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
authenticated as any user. So let's
 

251
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,670
authenticated as any user. So let's
change the entry page. So I'm just going

252
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
change the entry page. So I'm just going
 

253
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,830
change the entry page. So I'm just going
to tell it to make sure the off page is

254
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
to tell it to make sure the off page is
 

255
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,830
to tell it to make sure the off page is
the entry page. All right, great. That's

256
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
the entry page. All right, great. That's
 

257
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,870
the entry page. All right, great. That's
done. Great. So, we're signed in, but I

258
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
done. Great. So, we're signed in, but I
 

259
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,070
done. Great. So, we're signed in, but I
don't think this button is working right

260
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
don't think this button is working right
 

261
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,990
don't think this button is working right
here. So, what I'm going to do is I'm

262
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
here. So, what I'm going to do is I'm
 

263
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,909
here. So, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to turn on inspect mode right

264
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
going to turn on inspect mode right
 

265
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,550
going to turn on inspect mode right
here. And this button right here, I want

266
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
here. And this button right here, I want
 

267
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,070
here. And this button right here, I want
to rightclick and add it to the agent

268
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
to rightclick and add it to the agent
 

269
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,270
to rightclick and add it to the agent
context right here. And say this button

270
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
context right here. And say this button
 

271
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,110
context right here. And say this button
is always disabled. Make sure it's

272
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
is always disabled. Make sure it's
 

273
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,150
is always disabled. Make sure it's
working properly. All right, that's

274
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
working properly. All right, that's
 

275
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,350
working properly. All right, that's
done. So, let's test it out here. create

276
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
done. So, let's test it out here. create
 

277
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,950
done. So, let's test it out here. create
Dreamflow tutorial.

278
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
Dreamflow tutorial.
 

279
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,430
Dreamflow tutorial.
Beautiful. Now, so far we've used our

280
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
Beautiful. Now, so far we've used our
 

281
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,990
Beautiful. Now, so far we've used our
agent to make changes to our app. We've

282
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
agent to make changes to our app. We've
 

283
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,230
agent to make changes to our app. We've
selected widgets and modified their

284
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
selected widgets and modified their
 

285
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,390
selected widgets and modified their
properties in the property panel. But

286
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
properties in the property panel. But
 

287
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,990
properties in the property panel. But
there's one other way that you can

288
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
there's one other way that you can
 

289
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,830
there's one other way that you can
interact with your app. And that's

290
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
interact with your app. And that's
 

291
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,150
interact with your app. And that's
directly with the code. And you can see

292
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
directly with the code. And you can see
 

293
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,870
directly with the code. And you can see
that up here. So, if I go into code

294
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
that up here. So, if I go into code
 

295
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,430
that up here. So, if I go into code
view, you can see I have full file

296
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
view, you can see I have full file
 

297
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,150
view, you can see I have full file
system access where you can edit any

298
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
system access where you can edit any
 

299
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,029
system access where you can edit any
file. But it gets better because I can

300
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
file. But it gets better because I can
 

301
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,230
file. But it gets better because I can
go into split view right here and let's

302
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
go into split view right here and let's
 

303
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,990
go into split view right here and let's
close our agent to make a little bit

304
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
close our agent to make a little bit
 

305
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,189
close our agent to make a little bit
more room. And if I'm in inspect mode, I

306
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
more room. And if I'm in inspect mode, I
 

307
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,749
more room. And if I'm in inspect mode, I
can select whatever widget I want and

308
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
can select whatever widget I want and
 

309
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,990
can select whatever widget I want and
it'll bring me right there to that

310
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
it'll bring me right there to that
 

311
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,710
it'll bring me right there to that
widget. I can edit it. So let's just

312
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
widget. I can edit it. So let's just
 

313
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,430
widget. I can edit it. So let's just
call this task. And when I save it,

314
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
call this task. And when I save it,
 

315
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,830
call this task. And when I save it,
those changes will be propagated in all

316
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
those changes will be propagated in all
 

317
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,629
those changes will be propagated in all
of the development surfaces. Also, if I

318
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
of the development surfaces. Also, if I
 

319
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,749
of the development surfaces. Also, if I
select a widget in here, each context

320
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
select a widget in here, each context
 

321
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,230
select a widget in here, each context
will be highlighted in the preview and

322
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
will be highlighted in the preview and
 

323
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,990
