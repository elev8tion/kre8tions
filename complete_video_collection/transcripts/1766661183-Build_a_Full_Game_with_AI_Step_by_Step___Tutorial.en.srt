00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,910

My name is John and I work in developer

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:01,920
My name is John and I work in developer
 

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,390
My name is John and I work in developer
relations. I'm building a party game

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
relations. I'm building a party game
 

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,869
relations. I'm building a party game
called the hierarchy of fruit. And this

6
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:06,879
called the hierarchy of fruit. And this
 

7
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,350
called the hierarchy of fruit. And this
is where you can go in and you can rank

8
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
is where you can go in and you can rank
 

9
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,509
is where you can go in and you can rank
fruit. So you can take one here. I'll

10
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
fruit. So you can take one here. I'll
 

11
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,669
fruit. So you can take one here. I'll
give it a two. No, I'll give it a one

12
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679
give it a two. No, I'll give it a one
 

13
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,669
give it a two. No, I'll give it a one
right there. Leave a comment. We're

14
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:15,679
right there. Leave a comment. We're
 

15
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,070
right there. Leave a comment. We're
going to build this all right here. It's

16
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
going to build this all right here. It's
 

17
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,150
going to build this all right here. It's
a fun game to play with your friends or

18
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,160
a fun game to play with your friends or
 

19
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,990
a fun game to play with your friends or
your family and I'll show you how. All

20
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
your family and I'll show you how. All
 

21
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,830
your family and I'll show you how. All
right. So, how do we want to start

22
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
right. So, how do we want to start
 

23
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,230
right. So, how do we want to start
building this game? Now, of course, you

24
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
building this game? Now, of course, you
 

25
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,470
building this game? Now, of course, you
could start right here and give in a

26
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,480
could start right here and give in a
 

27
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,109
could start right here and give in a
prompt and start building your app, but

28
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
prompt and start building your app, but
 

29
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,270
prompt and start building your app, but
I would actually recommend not doing

30
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
I would actually recommend not doing
 

31
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,350
I would actually recommend not doing
that, and that's because if you do a

32
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
that, and that's because if you do a
 

33
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,830
that, and that's because if you do a
little bit of planning beforehand and

34
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
little bit of planning beforehand and
 

35
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,389
little bit of planning beforehand and
collect some assets and come up with a

36
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
collect some assets and come up with a
 

37
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,630
collect some assets and come up with a
plan, you're going to end up having a

38
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
plan, you're going to end up having a
 

39
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,869
plan, you're going to end up having a
better app. So, let me show you what I'm

40
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
better app. So, let me show you what I'm
 

41
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,430
better app. So, let me show you what I'm
starting with. The first thing is I

42
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
starting with. The first thing is I
 

43
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,110
starting with. The first thing is I
started with a concept. I already have

44
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
started with a concept. I already have
 

45
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,670
started with a concept. I already have
an app idea in mind, and it's a game,

46
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
an app idea in mind, and it's a game,
 

47
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,150
an app idea in mind, and it's a game,
and it's called the hierarchy of fruit.

48
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
and it's called the hierarchy of fruit.
 

49
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,069
and it's called the hierarchy of fruit.
And the idea of this game is that it

50
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
And the idea of this game is that it
 

51
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,430
And the idea of this game is that it
takes 22 different fruits and you rank

52
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
takes 22 different fruits and you rank
 

53
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,189
takes 22 different fruits and you rank
them. Okay? And you can do this with

54
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
them. Okay? And you can do this with
 

55
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,270
them. Okay? And you can do this with
your family or your friends. So you can

56
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
your family or your friends. So you can
 

57
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,189
your family or your friends. So you can
choose a room to go into and just play

58
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
choose a room to go into and just play
 

59
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,750
choose a room to go into and just play
it with them. Or there'll be a global GL

60
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
it with them. Or there'll be a global GL
 

61
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,630
it with them. Or there'll be a global GL
game as well. And the idea is that you

62
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
game as well. And the idea is that you
 

63
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,429
game as well. And the idea is that you
select a tier. So tier one is the best

64
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
select a tier. So tier one is the best
 

65
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,789
select a tier. So tier one is the best
fruit and tier two is fine and tier

66
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
fruit and tier two is fine and tier
 

67
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,429
fruit and tier two is fine and tier
three is either a bad fruit or

68
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
three is either a bad fruit or
 

69
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,190
three is either a bad fruit or
deceptive. And I'll give you an example

70
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
deceptive. And I'll give you an example
 

71
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,910
deceptive. And I'll give you an example
of one of those. That's dragon fruit.

72
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
of one of those. That's dragon fruit.
 

73
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,429
of one of those. That's dragon fruit.
Dragon fruit looks amazing, but it's

74
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
Dragon fruit looks amazing, but it's
 

75
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,310
Dragon fruit looks amazing, but it's
just like slightly sweet. Okay, it's a

76
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
just like slightly sweet. Okay, it's a
 

77
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,270
just like slightly sweet. Okay, it's a
deceptive fruit. Dragon fruit is a tier

78
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
deceptive fruit. Dragon fruit is a tier
 

79
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,830
deceptive fruit. Dragon fruit is a tier
three fruit. Okay, and that reason I

80
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
three fruit. Okay, and that reason I
 

81
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,749
three fruit. Okay, and that reason I
would put in here. So, when you're done,

82
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
would put in here. So, when you're done,
 

83
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,069
would put in here. So, when you're done,
you can look at everyone's rankings and

84
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
you can look at everyone's rankings and
 

85
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,109
you can look at everyone's rankings and
you can see the reasons why they did it.

86
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
you can see the reasons why they did it.
 

87
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,190
you can see the reasons why they did it.
Okay, so that's the concept for the

88
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
Okay, so that's the concept for the
 

89
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,830
Okay, so that's the concept for the
game. And I've got some simple UI here.

90
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
game. And I've got some simple UI here.
 

91
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,510
game. And I've got some simple UI here.
So, I've got this little logo. I've got

92
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
So, I've got this little logo. I've got
 

93
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,429
So, I've got this little logo. I've got
the rating screen. I've got some

94
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
the rating screen. I've got some
 

95
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,230
the rating screen. I've got some
onboarding screens and I've got the

96
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
onboarding screens and I've got the
 

97
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,630
onboarding screens and I've got the
concept and I've written that down. And

98
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
concept and I've written that down. And
 

99
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,109
concept and I've written that down. And
why this is helpful is because the very

100
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
why this is helpful is because the very
 

101
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,709
why this is helpful is because the very
first thing you want to do when you're

102
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
first thing you want to do when you're
 

103
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,429
first thing you want to do when you're
working with AI agents is give it the

104
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
working with AI agents is give it the
 

105
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,950
working with AI agents is give it the
overall plan. And that's because as it's

106
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
overall plan. And that's because as it's
 

107
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,869
overall plan. And that's because as it's
making decisions, it will always

108
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
making decisions, it will always
 

109
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,589
making decisions, it will always
reference that plan. So whenever the

110
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
reference that plan. So whenever the
 

111
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,869
reference that plan. So whenever the
model has any ambiguity, the context

112
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
model has any ambiguity, the context
 

113
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,350
model has any ambiguity, the context
will be the context of what you are

114
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
will be the context of what you are
 

115
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,990
will be the context of what you are
trying to accomplish. Okay. So, we've

116
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
trying to accomplish. Okay. So, we've
 

117
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,910
trying to accomplish. Okay. So, we've
got some assets. We've got the idea of

118
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
got some assets. We've got the idea of
 

119
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,830
got some assets. We've got the idea of
the game. And I'm not going to start

120
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
the game. And I'm not going to start
 

121
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,830
the game. And I'm not going to start
with this prompt here. Starting with the

122
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
with this prompt here. Starting with the
 

123
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,990
with this prompt here. Starting with the
prompt here is good when you want the

124
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
prompt here is good when you want the
 

125
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,550
prompt here is good when you want the
model to do a lot of work. But what we

126
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
model to do a lot of work. But what we
 

127
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,790
model to do a lot of work. But what we
want to do is we want to work slower,

128
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
want to do is we want to work slower,
 

129
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,830
want to do is we want to work slower,
step by step, because AI models are

130
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
step by step, because AI models are
 

131
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,470
step by step, because AI models are
great, fast, junior engineers, but

132
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
great, fast, junior engineers, but
 

133
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,949
great, fast, junior engineers, but
sometimes overeager, and they'll build a

134
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
sometimes overeager, and they'll build a
 

135
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,710
sometimes overeager, and they'll build a
lot of stuff that you might want, but

136
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
lot of stuff that you might want, but
 

137
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,390
lot of stuff that you might want, but
you might not want. So, instead, we're

138
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
you might not want. So, instead, we're
 

139
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,630
you might not want. So, instead, we're
going to do a new project right here.

140
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
going to do a new project right here.
 

141
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,869
going to do a new project right here.
We're going to call it hierarchy of

142
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
We're going to call it hierarchy of
 

143
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,350
We're going to call it hierarchy of
fruit and we're going to create this

144
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
fruit and we're going to create this
 

145
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,750
fruit and we're going to create this
project. Okay, we've just got this basic

146
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
project. Okay, we've just got this basic
 

147
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,150
project. Okay, we've just got this basic
scaffolded app here and we're ready to

148
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
scaffolded app here and we're ready to
 

149
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,750
scaffolded app here and we're ready to
start working. So, the first thing you

150
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
start working. So, the first thing you
 

151
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,390
start working. So, the first thing you
always want to do is give your agent a

152
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
always want to do is give your agent a
 

153
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,470
always want to do is give your agent a
plan. So, first I'm going to select

154
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
plan. So, first I'm going to select
 

155
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,710
plan. So, first I'm going to select
Claude right here. And I'm going to tell

156
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
Claude right here. And I'm going to tell
 

157
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,509
Claude right here. And I'm going to tell
the agent, I want you to create a plan,

158
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
the agent, I want you to create a plan,
 

159
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,270
the agent, I want you to create a plan,
MD file that keeps track of the project

160
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
MD file that keeps track of the project
 

161
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,390
MD file that keeps track of the project
description, tasks, and subtasks and app

162
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
description, tasks, and subtasks and app
 

163
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,270
description, tasks, and subtasks and app
architecture. So, this plan file will be

164
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
architecture. So, this plan file will be
 

165
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,750
architecture. So, this plan file will be
the source of truth for our agent.

166
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
the source of truth for our agent.
 

167
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,949
the source of truth for our agent.
Please create this file. Okay, the agent

168
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
Please create this file. Okay, the agent
 

169
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,030
Please create this file. Okay, the agent
is going to go create that file. I want

170
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
is going to go create that file. I want
 

171
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,030
is going to go create that file. I want
to see it come in right here. So, let's

172
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
to see it come in right here. So, let's
 

173
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,670
to see it come in right here. So, let's
just wait. It's looking at what our

174
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
just wait. It's looking at what our
 

175
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,910
just wait. It's looking at what our
project looks like currently. And now

176
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
project looks like currently. And now
 

177
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,149
project looks like currently. And now
it's going to create this file. Okay,

178
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
it's going to create this file. Okay,
 

179
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,070
it's going to create this file. Okay,
great. It's created this file. Let's

180
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
great. It's created this file. Let's
 

181
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,149
great. It's created this file. Let's
open this up. You could click here or we

182
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
open this up. You could click here or we
 

183
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,789
open this up. You could click here or we
can go up and just click on here and

184
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
can go up and just click on here and
 

185
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,309
can go up and just click on here and
it's going to open up. And let's see

186
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
it's going to open up. And let's see
 

187
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,390
it's going to open up. And let's see
what it says right here. It has the

188
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
what it says right here. It has the
 

189
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,869
what it says right here. It has the
title, the type of application. It

190
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
title, the type of application. It
 

191
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,390
title, the type of application. It
recognizes that it's a new Flutter

192
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
recognizes that it's a new Flutter
 

193
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,710
recognizes that it's a new Flutter
project in the starter phase with basic

194
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
project in the starter phase with basic
 

195
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,470
project in the starter phase with basic
counter functionality. So, it knows it's

196
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
counter functionality. So, it knows it's
 

197
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,710
counter functionality. So, it knows it's
just that basic file right now. and it

198
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
just that basic file right now. and it
 

199
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,630
just that basic file right now. and it
started some check mark stuff here. We

200
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
started some check mark stuff here. We
 

201
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,550
started some check mark stuff here. We
don't need any of this stuff right now,

202
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
don't need any of this stuff right now,
 

203
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,550
don't need any of this stuff right now,
but it'll update this accordingly. So,

204
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
but it'll update this accordingly. So,
 

205
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,990
but it'll update this accordingly. So,
we don't have to worry about deleting

206
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
we don't have to worry about deleting
 

207
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,710
we don't have to worry about deleting
all of that. Okay. So, now we're going

208
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
all of that. Okay. So, now we're going
 

209
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,110
all of that. Okay. So, now we're going
to give it the plan for our app. So,

210
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
to give it the plan for our app. So,
 

211
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,030
to give it the plan for our app. So,
I've got some copy here that I've

212
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
I've got some copy here that I've
 

213
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,229
I've got some copy here that I've
already written. So, I'm going to paste

214
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
already written. So, I'm going to paste
 

215
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,550
already written. So, I'm going to paste
it in here and I say I want to create a

216
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
it in here and I say I want to create a
 

217
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,469
it in here and I say I want to create a
game app called Hierarchy of Fruit. The

218
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
game app called Hierarchy of Fruit. The
 

219
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,950
game app called Hierarchy of Fruit. The
main idea is that users will rank 22

220
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
main idea is that users will rank 22
 

221
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,310
main idea is that users will rank 22
fruits as one of three tiers. With each

222
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
fruits as one of three tiers. With each
 

223
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,070
fruits as one of three tiers. With each
fruit, they'll give it a rank and can

224
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
fruit, they'll give it a rank and can
 

225
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,469
fruit, they'll give it a rank and can
include a comment as to why. When

226
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
include a comment as to why. When
 

227
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,830
include a comment as to why. When
they're done, there's a final scoreboard

228
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
they're done, there's a final scoreboard
 

229
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,590
they're done, there's a final scoreboard
that shows the aggregated ranking of all

230
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
that shows the aggregated ranking of all
 

231
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,430
that shows the aggregated ranking of all
the fruits in the comments. And there

232
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
the fruits in the comments. And there
 

233
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,590
the fruits in the comments. And there
are two options, a global game and a a

234
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
are two options, a global game and a a
 

235
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,710
are two options, a global game and a a
room code you can share with your

236
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
room code you can share with your
 

237
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,390
room code you can share with your
friends and family. And I'm going to use

238
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
friends and family. And I'm going to use
 

239
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,070
friends and family. And I'm going to use
Firebase for my database and

240
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
Firebase for my database and
 

241
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,749
Firebase for my database and
authentication. So that's my

242
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
authentication. So that's my
 

243
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,510
authentication. So that's my
description. And I just want right now

244
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
description. And I just want right now
 

245
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,350
description. And I just want right now
the agent to update the plan.md with

246
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
the agent to update the plan.md with
 

247
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,749
the agent to update the plan.md with
this information. Now notice as we're

248
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
this information. Now notice as we're
 

249
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,670
this information. Now notice as we're
working, the agent isn't actually

250
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
working, the agent isn't actually
 

251
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,909
working, the agent isn't actually
writing any code yet because we gave it

252
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
writing any code yet because we gave it
 

253
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,629
writing any code yet because we gave it
the instructions to just edit this file.

254
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
the instructions to just edit this file.
 

255
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,870
the instructions to just edit this file.
Probably the two most important things

256
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
Probably the two most important things
 

257
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,749
Probably the two most important things
when you're working with AI agent is one

258
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
when you're working with AI agent is one
 

259
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,550
when you're working with AI agent is one
to be explicit because the AI agent

260
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
to be explicit because the AI agent
 

261
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,390
to be explicit because the AI agent
knows nothing about you or your app or

262
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
knows nothing about you or your app or
 

263
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,390
knows nothing about you or your app or
your context unless you tell it. And one

264
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
your context unless you tell it. And one
 

265
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,990
your context unless you tell it. And one
mistake we can kind of have is that

266
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
mistake we can kind of have is that
 

267
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,629
mistake we can kind of have is that
because LLMs are so adept, we can

268
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
because LLMs are so adept, we can
 

269
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,390
because LLMs are so adept, we can
sometimes think that it knows more than

270
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
sometimes think that it knows more than
 

271
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,270
sometimes think that it knows more than
it does. So be specific. And the second

272
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
it does. So be specific. And the second
 

273
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,629
it does. So be specific. And the second
thing is to work in small steps. One of

274
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
thing is to work in small steps. One of
 

275
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,870
thing is to work in small steps. One of
the best ways to reduce hallucinations

276
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
the best ways to reduce hallucinations
 

277
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,230
the best ways to reduce hallucinations
of agents is to give it one small

278
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
of agents is to give it one small
 

279
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,590
of agents is to give it one small
contained task at a time. Okay, now it's

280
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
contained task at a time. Okay, now it's
 

281
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,990
contained task at a time. Okay, now it's
done here. So let's take a look at the

282
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
done here. So let's take a look at the
 

283
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,230
done here. So let's take a look at the
changes it made right here. So we have

284
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
changes it made right here. So we have
 

285
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,230
changes it made right here. So we have
the project description. We have the

286
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
the project description. We have the
 

287
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,870
the project description. We have the
game concept. That looks good. We've got

288
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
game concept. That looks good. We've got
 

289
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,430
game concept. That looks good. We've got
some features right here. We've got the

290
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
some features right here. We've got the
 

291
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,550
some features right here. We've got the
text stack. That all looks good. And as

292
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
text stack. That all looks good. And as
 

293
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,469
text stack. That all looks good. And as
I'm looking through here, it hasn't

294
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
I'm looking through here, it hasn't
 

295
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,230
I'm looking through here, it hasn't
decided on what state management we

296
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
decided on what state management we
 

297
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,830
decided on what state management we
need. We don't really need anything

298
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
need. We don't really need anything
 

299
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,510
need. We don't really need anything
complex. So, we're going to use

300
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
complex. So, we're going to use
 

301
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,510
complex. So, we're going to use
provider. So, I'm just going to delete

302
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
provider. So, I'm just going to delete
 

303
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,909
provider. So, I'm just going to delete
that and save it. And remember, because

304
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
that and save it. And remember, because
 

305
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,150
that and save it. And remember, because
I told the model to keep track of these

306
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
I told the model to keep track of these
 

307
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,390
I told the model to keep track of these
things, it will refer back and see this

308
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
things, it will refer back and see this
 

309
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,710
things, it will refer back and see this
change. It gave a planned project

310
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
change. It gave a planned project
 

311
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,550
change. It gave a planned project
structure. Now, it hasn't created any of

312
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
structure. Now, it hasn't created any of
 

313
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,870
structure. Now, it hasn't created any of
this yet. It just has come up with this

314
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
this yet. It just has come up with this
 

315
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,350
this yet. It just has come up with this
structure right now. And as we're going

316
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
structure right now. And as we're going
 

317
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,110
structure right now. And as we're going
through here, you can see that it's

318
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
through here, you can see that it's
 

319
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,029
through here, you can see that it's
starting to check off the different

320
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
starting to check off the different
 

321
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,830
starting to check off the different
tasks that it's thought is important.

322
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
tasks that it's thought is important.
 

323
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,309
tasks that it's thought is important.
Let's just look through here. Okay, this

324
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
Let's just look through here. Okay, this
 

325
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,909
Let's just look through here. Okay, this
is looking good except for I want to

326
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
is looking good except for I want to
 

327
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,430
is looking good except for I want to
change the list of fruits. So, update

328
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
change the list of fruits. So, update
 

329
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,350
change the list of fruits. So, update
the fruits to these. Okay, that looks

330
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
the fruits to these. Okay, that looks
 

331
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,950
the fruits to these. Okay, that looks
great. I've updated these. I've put them

332
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
great. I've updated these. I've put them
 

333
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,870
great. I've updated these. I've put them
in the order that I want. Now, I have a

334
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
in the order that I want. Now, I have a
 

335
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,790
in the order that I want. Now, I have a
font that I want the app to use, and

336
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
font that I want the app to use, and
 

337
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,670
font that I want the app to use, and
that's Poppins in Google Font. So I

338
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
that's Poppins in Google Font. So I
 

339
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,189
that's Poppins in Google Font. So I
would like to use the Google font

340
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
would like to use the Google font
 

341
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,670
would like to use the Google font
Poppins. All right, great. So this

342
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
Poppins. All right, great. So this
 

343
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,070
Poppins. All right, great. So this
updated. So we're using the Poppins.

344
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
updated. So we're using the Poppins.
 

345
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,749
updated. So we're using the Poppins.
We're already using Google Fonts. So

346
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
We're already using Google Fonts. So
 

347
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,350
We're already using Google Fonts. So
that's great. All right, next step.

348
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
that's great. All right, next step.
 

349
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,230
that's great. All right, next step.
Let's plan the schema for Fire Store for

350
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
Let's plan the schema for Fire Store for
 

351
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,070
Let's plan the schema for Fire Store for
our backend. So let's say plan the

352
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
our backend. So let's say plan the
 

353
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,029
our backend. So let's say plan the
schema for Fire Store and store in

354
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
schema for Fire Store and store in
 

355
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,550
schema for Fire Store and store in
plan.md.

356
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
plan.md.
 

357
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,870
plan.md.
Okay, that's done. Let's take a look at

358
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
Okay, that's done. Let's take a look at
 

359
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,710
Okay, that's done. Let's take a look at
what it did here. We don't have to jump

360
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
what it did here. We don't have to jump
 

361
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,029
what it did here. We don't have to jump
in here. We got a users collection, our

362
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
in here. We got a users collection, our
 

363
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,550
in here. We got a users collection, our
fruits, the different rooms, game

364
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
fruits, the different rooms, game
 

365
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,790
fruits, the different rooms, game
section, rankings, global stats.

366
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
section, rankings, global stats.
 

367
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,510
section, rankings, global stats.
Beautiful. That looks great. Okay, so

368
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
Beautiful. That looks great. Okay, so
 

369
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,430
Beautiful. That looks great. Okay, so
we've got our plan now. We've got our

370
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
we've got our plan now. We've got our
 

371
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,990
we've got our plan now. We've got our
database schema. So now we're ready to

372
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
database schema. So now we're ready to
 

373
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,150
database schema. So now we're ready to
integrate Firebase. So let's go over to

374
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
integrate Firebase. So let's go over to
 

375
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,390
integrate Firebase. So let's go over to
our Firebase tab. Let's connect to

376
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
our Firebase tab. Let's connect to
 

377
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,390
our Firebase tab. Let's connect to
Firebase and we're going to create a new

378
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
Firebase and we're going to create a new
 

379
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,909
Firebase and we're going to create a new
project. This will just take a few

380
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
project. This will just take a few
 

381
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,350
project. This will just take a few
minutes to set up. But the important

382
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
minutes to set up. But the important
 

383
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,350
minutes to set up. But the important
part is that now that we have a plan,

384
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
part is that now that we have a plan,
 

385
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,870
part is that now that we have a plan,
when we actually generate the code,

386
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
when we actually generate the code,
 

387
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,950
when we actually generate the code,
it'll be able to generate the schema and

388
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
it'll be able to generate the schema and
 

389
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,110
it'll be able to generate the schema and
the security rules that are particular

390
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
the security rules that are particular
 

391
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,350
the security rules that are particular
to our application. Okay, the project's

392
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
to our application. Okay, the project's
 

393
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,350
to our application. Okay, the project's
been created in Firebase. So now let's

394
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
been created in Firebase. So now let's
 

395
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,189
been created in Firebase. So now let's
configure Firebase. Now, one thing to

396
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
configure Firebase. Now, one thing to
 

397
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,029
configure Firebase. Now, one thing to
keep in mind as this is building, you

398
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
keep in mind as this is building, you
 

399
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,950
keep in mind as this is building, you
may see some errors in your project, but

400
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
may see some errors in your project, but
 

401
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,350
may see some errors in your project, but
those will go away. The analyzer is just

402
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
those will go away. The analyzer is just
 

403
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,830
those will go away. The analyzer is just
continually checking the project while

404
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
continually checking the project while
 

405
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,270
continually checking the project while
it's building, so don't worry about

406
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
it's building, so don't worry about
 

407
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,270
it's building, so don't worry about
that. All right, that's configured. It

408
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
that. All right, that's configured. It
 

409
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,909
that. All right, that's configured. It
defaults to three target platforms.

410
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
defaults to three target platforms.
 

411
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,550
defaults to three target platforms.
That's great. So now let's generate some

412
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
That's great. So now let's generate some
 

413
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,110
That's great. So now let's generate some
client code. Now you can see here as

414
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
client code. Now you can see here as
 

415
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,150
client code. Now you can see here as
it's planning out it that it references

416
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
it's planning out it that it references
 

417
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,110
it's planning out it that it references
our plan MD file so it knows what to

418
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
our plan MD file so it knows what to
 

419
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,029
our plan MD file so it knows what to
generate. All right, that's done. Now we

420
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
generate. All right, that's done. Now we
 

421
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,589
generate. All right, that's done. Now we
want to deploy to Firebase right here.

422
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
want to deploy to Firebase right here.
 

423
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,510
want to deploy to Firebase right here.
Okay, great. Now let's configure our

424
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
Okay, great. Now let's configure our
 

425
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,029
Okay, great. Now let's configure our
authentication. This is just going to

426
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
authentication. This is just going to
 

427
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,110
authentication. This is just going to
bring us to the Firebase console. So

428
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
bring us to the Firebase console. So
 

429
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,670
bring us to the Firebase console. So
we're right here. Let's get started. And

430
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
we're right here. Let's get started. And
 

431
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,830
we're right here. Let's get started. And
we'll just do email and password for

432
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
we'll just do email and password for
 

433
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,070
we'll just do email and password for
now. So let's enable that and we're

434
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
now. So let's enable that and we're
 

435
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,990
now. So let's enable that and we're
ready to go. Okay, now this is ready to

436
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
ready to go. Okay, now this is ready to
 

437
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,150
ready to go. Okay, now this is ready to
test. But I wanted to follow up on one

438
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
test. But I wanted to follow up on one
 

439
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,469
test. But I wanted to follow up on one
thing about this aspect when it

440
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
thing about this aspect when it
 

441
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,709
thing about this aspect when it
generated the schema. Now it generated

442
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
generated the schema. Now it generated
 

443
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,190
generated the schema. Now it generated
the schema based on what it knew about

444
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
the schema based on what it knew about
 

445
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,190
the schema based on what it knew about
my project already. And that's why we

446
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
my project already. And that's why we
 

447
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,990
my project already. And that's why we
took the time to give the agent a plan.

448
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
took the time to give the agent a plan.
 

449
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,670
took the time to give the agent a plan.
Okay, so let's test this out and make

450
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
Okay, so let's test this out and make
 

451
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,110
Okay, so let's test this out and make
sure the authentication is working

452
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
sure the authentication is working
 

453
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,230
sure the authentication is working
correctly. So let's sign up and let's

454
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
correctly. So let's sign up and let's
 

455
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,550
correctly. So let's sign up and let's
add my email. Great, that's working.

456
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
add my email. Great, that's working.
 

457
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,790
add my email. Great, that's working.
Beautiful. Okay, so next I actually want

458
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
Beautiful. Okay, so next I actually want
 

459
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,230
Beautiful. Okay, so next I actually want
it to default to light mode. So let's

460
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
it to default to light mode. So let's
 

461
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,790
it to default to light mode. So let's
have the default be light mode. Okay,

462
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
have the default be light mode. Okay,
 

463
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,389
have the default be light mode. Okay,
that's getting better. Okay, that's

464
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
that's getting better. Okay, that's
 

465
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,310
that's getting better. Okay, that's
looking great. But let me actually go

466
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
looking great. But let me actually go
 

467
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,350
looking great. But let me actually go
back and sign out for a second because I

468
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
back and sign out for a second because I
 

469
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,670
back and sign out for a second because I
want to redesign this page. And if you

470
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
want to redesign this page. And if you
 

471
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,630
want to redesign this page. And if you
remember, I have some UI that I created

472
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
remember, I have some UI that I created
 

473
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,030
remember, I have some UI that I created
for this. So, I'm going to drop this in

474
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
for this. So, I'm going to drop this in
 

475
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,550
for this. So, I'm going to drop this in
and I'm going to select specifically

476
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
and I'm going to select specifically
 

477
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,110
and I'm going to select specifically
GPT5 because it's the model that has the

478
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
GPT5 because it's the model that has the
 

479
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,829
GPT5 because it's the model that has the
best visual understanding of UI. And I'm

480
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
best visual understanding of UI. And I'm
 

481
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,350
best visual understanding of UI. And I'm
going to say, please redesign the

482
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
going to say, please redesign the
 

483
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,030
going to say, please redesign the

Ask any questions if you are unsure

488
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
Ask any questions if you are unsure
 

489
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,350
Ask any questions if you are unsure
about something with the design or

490
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
about something with the design or
 

491
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,509
about something with the design or
implementation. We've published a video

492
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
implementation. We've published a video
 

493
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,949
implementation. We've published a video
on this before, but there's some

494
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
on this before, but there's some
 

495
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,790
on this before, but there's some
research to suggest that if you

496
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
research to suggest that if you
 

497
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,030
research to suggest that if you
explicitly ask for clarification

498
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
explicitly ask for clarification
 

499
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,190
explicitly ask for clarification
questions, the model performs better

500
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
questions, the model performs better
 

501
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,389
questions, the model performs better
because you as the user and developer

502
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
because you as the user and developer
 

503
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,550
because you as the user and developer
clarify the uncertainty instead of the

504
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
clarify the uncertainty instead of the
 

505
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,790
clarify the uncertainty instead of the
model. Okay, so it did come back with

506
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
model. Okay, so it did come back with
 

507
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,990
model. Okay, so it did come back with
some questions before its

508
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
some questions before its
 

509
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,829
some questions before its
implementation, which is great. So,

510
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
implementation, which is great. So,
 

511
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,829
implementation, which is great. So,
let's read through these. Signin versus

512
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
let's read through these. Signin versus
 

513
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,829
let's read through these. Signin versus
signup. The design shows a sign up page

514
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
signup. The design shows a sign up page
 

515
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,910
signup. The design shows a sign up page
with four fields. Do you also want a

516
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
with four fields. Do you also want a
 

517
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,230
with four fields. Do you also want a
sign-in page? Uh, yes. That's a good

518
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
sign-in page? Uh, yes. That's a good
 

519
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,030
sign-in page? Uh, yes. That's a good
point. We didn't add that in. So yes,

520
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
point. We didn't add that in. So yes,
 

521
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,790
point. We didn't add that in. So yes,
both sign up and sign in with a toggle

522
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
both sign up and sign in with a toggle
 

523
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,150
both sign up and sign in with a toggle
on brand. Okay. Bottom indicators. I see

524
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
on brand. Okay. Bottom indicators. I see
 

525
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,829
on brand. Okay. Bottom indicators. I see
two indicators. Are these indicators

526
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
two indicators. Are these indicators
 

527
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,190
two indicators. Are these indicators
suggesting there should be multiple

528
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
suggesting there should be multiple
 

529
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,829
suggesting there should be multiple
screens. That was for the sign up and

530
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
screens. That was for the sign up and
 

531
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,910
screens. That was for the sign up and
sign in. But you don't have to follow

532
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
sign in. But you don't have to follow
 

533
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,030
sign in. But you don't have to follow
that design. Implement whatever UI UX is

534
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
that design. Implement whatever UI UX is
 

535
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,590
that design. Implement whatever UI UX is
best. three. It's just asking for if

536
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
best. three. It's just asking for if
 

537
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,069
best. three. It's just asking for if
I've got the logo. I'll just say just

538
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
I've got the logo. I'll just say just
 

539
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,829
I've got the logo. I'll just say just
use placeholder. And then color scheme,

540
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
use placeholder. And then color scheme,
 

541
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,750
use placeholder. And then color scheme,
the yellow background. Uh, yes. Use that

542
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
the yellow background. Uh, yes. Use that
 

543
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,190
the yellow background. Uh, yes. Use that
as primary color. And finally, clear

544
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
as primary color. And finally, clear
 

545
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,590
as primary color. And finally, clear
icons have an X button while the

546
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
icons have an X button while the
 

547
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,509
icons have an X button while the
password fields have an I icon for

548
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
password fields have an I icon for
 

549
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,389
password fields have an I icon for
visibly. Should both be functional? Uh,

550
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
visibly. Should both be functional? Uh,
 

551
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,949
visibly. Should both be functional? Uh,
yes. That would be nice. Both be

552
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
yes. That would be nice. Both be
 

553
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,509
yes. That would be nice. Both be
functional. And I added in this, and

554
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
functional. And I added in this, and
 

555
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,630
functional. And I added in this, and
this is one of the most important things

556
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
this is one of the most important things
 

557
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,949
this is one of the most important things
when you're working with AI, is that you

558
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
when you're working with AI, is that you
 

559
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,750
when you're working with AI, is that you
want to reduce as much ambiguity as

560
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
want to reduce as much ambiguity as
 

561
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,150
want to reduce as much ambiguity as
possible and be as clear as possible.

562
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
possible and be as clear as possible.
 

563
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,630
possible and be as clear as possible.
That way, the model can allocate tokens

564
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
That way, the model can allocate tokens
 

565
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,030
That way, the model can allocate tokens
and work to more important things. So,

566
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
and work to more important things. So,
 

567
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,350
and work to more important things. So,
instead of just saying yes, I added some

568
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
instead of just saying yes, I added some
 

569
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,350
instead of just saying yes, I added some
clarification here. Okay, let's send it

570
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
clarification here. Okay, let's send it
 

571
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,509
clarification here. Okay, let's send it
off to do some work. Okay, and there we

572
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
off to do some work. Okay, and there we
 

573
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,069
off to do some work. Okay, and there we
go. We we've got some placeholder right

574
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
go. We we've got some placeholder right
 

575
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,910
go. We we've got some placeholder right
here, which we'll just replace later.

576
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
here, which we'll just replace later.
 

577
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,389
here, which we'll just replace later.
Two form fields. This is looking great.

578
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
Two form fields. This is looking great.
 

579
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,030
Two form fields. This is looking great.
And let's make sure the sign up works.

580
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
And let's make sure the sign up works.
 

581
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,550
And let's make sure the sign up works.
And the signup doesn't seem to be

582
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
And the signup doesn't seem to be
 

583
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,030
And the signup doesn't seem to be
working. So let's see if it says

584
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
working. So let's see if it says
 

585
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,829
working. So let's see if it says
anything here. And it doesn't. So let's

586
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
anything here. And it doesn't. So let's
 

587
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,389
anything here. And it doesn't. So let's
just say did you create the sign up

588
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
just say did you create the sign up
 

589
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,430
just say did you create the sign up
toggle so that users can easily switch

590
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
toggle so that users can easily switch
 

591
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,990
toggle so that users can easily switch
between signin and sign up. Okay, it

592
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
between signin and sign up. Okay, it
 

593
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,310
between signin and sign up. Okay, it
says that it already implemented it. So

594
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
says that it already implemented it. So
 

595
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,630
says that it already implemented it. So
let's give it a quick hot reload to make

596
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:00,640
let's give it a quick hot reload to make
 

597
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,750
let's give it a quick hot reload to make
sure. And oh, there it goes. But it's

598
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
sure. And oh, there it goes. But it's
 

599
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,990
sure. And oh, there it goes. But it's
kind of tiny and so I would like the

600
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
kind of tiny and so I would like the
 

601
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,590
kind of tiny and so I would like the
toggle to be easier to switch between.

602
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
toggle to be easier to switch between.
 

603
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,150
toggle to be easier to switch between.
Currently, it's small text that the user

604
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
Currently, it's small text that the user
 

605
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,949
Currently, it's small text that the user
has to press. Make it much easier and

606
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
has to press. Make it much easier and
 

607
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,350
has to press. Make it much easier and
larger to toggle between. Don't just

608
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
larger to toggle between. Don't just
 

609
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,190
larger to toggle between. Don't just
make the words bigger. change the UX.

black. Okay, great. Now, let's just test
 

625
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,710
black. Okay, great. Now, let's just test
that it's currently working. So, we're

626
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
that it's currently working. So, we're
 

627
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,470
that it's currently working. So, we're
going to turn off inspect mode. We're

628
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
going to turn off inspect mode. We're
 

629
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,750
going to turn off inspect mode. We're
going to sign in. Beautiful. That works.

630
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
going to sign in. Beautiful. That works.
 

631
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,150
going to sign in. Beautiful. That works.
Next, I want to implement the voting

632
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
Next, I want to implement the voting
 

633
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,870
Next, I want to implement the voting
screen. This one right here. So, I'm

634
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
screen. This one right here. So, I'm
 

635
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,829
screen. This one right here. So, I'm
going to attach it and say implement

636
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
going to attach it and say implement
 

637
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,470
going to attach it and say implement
this voting screen. This will be used

638
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
this voting screen. This will be used
 

639
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,550
this voting screen. This will be used
for each fruit. I want the background

640
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560
for each fruit. I want the background
 

641
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,030
for each fruit. I want the background
color to match the fruit.

642
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
color to match the fruit.
 

643
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,030
color to match the fruit.
Ask followup questions if you are

644
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
Ask followup questions if you are
 

645
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,750
Ask followup questions if you are
unclear about anything. And once again,

646
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
unclear about anything. And once again,
 

647
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,430
unclear about anything. And once again,
I got some more questions. And this is

648
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
I got some more questions. And this is
 

649
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,430
I got some more questions. And this is
just a good example of how many

650
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
just a good example of how many
 

651
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,509
just a good example of how many
decisions behind the scenes if you don't

652
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
decisions behind the scenes if you don't
 

653
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,350
decisions behind the scenes if you don't
ask for follow-up questions that the

654
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
ask for follow-up questions that the
 

655
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,829
ask for follow-up questions that the
model is actually making. So let's go

656
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
model is actually making. So let's go
 

657
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,910
model is actually making. So let's go
through these fruit colors. Where should

658
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
through these fruit colors. Where should
 

659
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,670
through these fruit colors. Where should
I get the colors for each fruit's

660
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
I get the colors for each fruit's
 

661
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,269
I get the colors for each fruit's
background? Should I define them

662
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
background? Should I define them
 

663
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,269
background? Should I define them
manually? Use a color palette to

664
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
manually? Use a color palette to
 

665
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,430
manually? Use a color palette to
generate them or just give them specific

666
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
generate them or just give them specific
 

667
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,829
generate them or just give them specific
colors? Generate manually for each and

668
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
colors? Generate manually for each and
 

669
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,990
colors? Generate manually for each and
add them as style constants in the

670
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
add them as style constants in the
 

671
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,870
add them as style constants in the
theme. Dart. And I'm saying that so I

672
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
theme. Dart. And I'm saying that so I
 

673
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,949
theme. Dart. And I'm saying that so I
can access them and augment them here.

674
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
can access them and augment them here.
 

675
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,629
can access them and augment them here.

743
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,629
tier three is either bad or deceptive.
Great. Okay, so that's implemented. So

744
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
Great. Okay, so that's implemented. So
 

745
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,389
Great. Okay, so that's implemented. So
let's start a global game so we can see

746
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
let's start a global game so we can see
 

747
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,269
let's start a global game so we can see
it. And that's not implemented yet. So

748
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
it. And that's not implemented yet. So
 

749
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,350
it. And that's not implemented yet. So
let's do that. But actually, let's

750
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
let's do that. But actually, let's
 

751
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,990
let's do that. But actually, let's
redesign this page so that it's more on

752
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
redesign this page so that it's more on
 

753
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,990
redesign this page so that it's more on
brand. Now the interesting thing is I

754
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
brand. Now the interesting thing is I
 

755
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,550
brand. Now the interesting thing is I
don't have a design for this page but we

756
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
don't have a design for this page but we
 

757
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,470
don't have a design for this page but we
already have some designs implemented

758
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
already have some designs implemented
 

759
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,870
already have some designs implemented
and I'm going to pass in those designs

760
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
and I'm going to pass in those designs
 

761
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,550
and I'm going to pass in those designs
again and ask it to use the same design

762
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
again and ask it to use the same design
 

763
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,069
again and ask it to use the same design
style. So update which page is it here?

764
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
style. So update which page is it here?
 

765
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,749
style. So update which page is it here?
Let's look. Okay, the home screen to be

766
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
Let's look. Okay, the home screen to be
 

767
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,030
Let's look. Okay, the home screen to be
on brand with similar style to the off

768
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
on brand with similar style to the off
 

769
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,430
on brand with similar style to the off
and voting pages. I've attached those

770
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
and voting pages. I've attached those
 

771
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,509
and voting pages. I've attached those
pages so you can see them again. And

772
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
pages so you can see them again. And
 

773
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,949
pages so you can see them again. And
here's a real interesting thing. It

774
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
here's a real interesting thing. It
 

775
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,310
here's a real interesting thing. It
followed up with some questions. Even

776
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
followed up with some questions. Even
 

777
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,990
followed up with some questions. Even
though I didn't ask it any questions

778
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
though I didn't ask it any questions
 

779
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,470
though I didn't ask it any questions
now, but because the agent has memory,

780
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
now, but because the agent has memory,
 

781
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,710
now, but because the agent has memory,
it knows that I like it to ask

782
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
it knows that I like it to ask
 

783
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,629
it knows that I like it to ask
clarifying questions. So, let's answer

784
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
clarifying questions. So, let's answer
 

785
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,550
clarifying questions. So, let's answer
some of these. Should the home screen

786
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
some of these. Should the home screen
 

787
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,150
some of these. Should the home screen
keep the same logo? Yes. Include the

811
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,750
to a visible button on screen or styled
differently? Let's remove app bar and

812
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
differently? Let's remove app bar and
 

813
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,230
differently? Let's remove app bar and
just have sign out button in top left.

814
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
just have sign out button in top left.
 

815
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,710
just have sign out button in top left.
Right. Do you want any decorative fruit

816
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
Right. Do you want any decorative fruit
 

817
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,230
Right. Do you want any decorative fruit
illustrations or icons on the home

818
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
illustrations or icons on the home
 

819
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,029
illustrations or icons on the home
screen similar to the voting page? Um,

820
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:39,039
screen similar to the voting page? Um,
 

821
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,590
screen similar to the voting page? Um,
no. I find that uh models are not good

822
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
no. I find that uh models are not good
 

823
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,750
no. I find that uh models are not good
with this kind of ornamentation. All

824
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760
with this kind of ornamentation. All
 

825
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,789
with this kind of ornamentation. All
right, go. Okay, there we go. A little

826
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
right, go. Okay, there we go. A little
 

827
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,110
right, go. Okay, there we go. A little
bland, but that's fine for now. So,

828
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
bland, but that's fine for now. So,
 

829
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,110
bland, but that's fine for now. So,
let's see. That's not working yet. So

830
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
let's see. That's not working yet. So
 

831
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,669
let's see. That's not working yet. So
now let's say implement the logic for

832
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
now let's say implement the logic for
 

833
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,990
now let's say implement the logic for
starting the global game. Now notice one

834
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
starting the global game. Now notice one
 

835
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,990
starting the global game. Now notice one
thing that I did. I could have added

836
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,000
thing that I did. I could have added
 

837
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,549
thing that I did. I could have added
this to the last one, but you want to

838
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
this to the last one, but you want to
 

839
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,549
this to the last one, but you want to
break things down into the smallest step

840
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
break things down into the smallest step
 

841
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,789
break things down into the smallest step
so the model can focus on just one thing

842
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
so the model can focus on just one thing
 

843
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,789
so the model can focus on just one thing
at a time. So I just want this button.

844
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
at a time. So I just want this button.
 

845
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,710
at a time. So I just want this button.
Then I'll do that one after it. Okay,

846
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
Then I'll do that one after it. Okay,
 

847
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,789
Then I'll do that one after it. Okay,
it's done. Let's see what changes it's

848
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
it's done. Let's see what changes it's
 

849
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,990
it's done. Let's see what changes it's
made. It made a game controller service.

850
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
made. It made a game controller service.
 

851
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,310
made. It made a game controller service.
It updated the home screen with the

852
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
It updated the home screen with the
 

853
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,270
It updated the home screen with the
functionality. Okay, that's great. And

854
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
functionality. Okay, that's great. And
 

855
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,549
functionality. Okay, that's great. And
it updated the voting screen. So, it

856
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
it updated the voting screen. So, it
 

857
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,270
it updated the voting screen. So, it
implements all the logic there. And then

858
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
implements all the logic there. And then
 

859
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,669
implements all the logic there. And then
the results screen. It accepts the

860
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
the results screen. It accepts the
 

861
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,470
the results screen. It accepts the
session ID and user ID for future

862
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,480
session ID and user ID for future
 

863
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,310
session ID and user ID for future
implementation. Okay, great. Let's start

864
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,320
implementation. Okay, great. Let's start
 

865
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,470
implementation. Okay, great. Let's start
a global game. And we're getting a

866
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
a global game. And we're getting a
 

867
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,310
a global game. And we're getting a
problem here. Let's take a look. Okay,

868
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
problem here. Let's take a look. Okay,
 

869
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,350
problem here. Let's take a look. Okay,
this requires an index. Okay, I created

870
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
this requires an index. Okay, I created
 

871
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,230
this requires an index. Okay, I created
the index. Now, let's start this game.

872
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
the index. Now, let's start this game.
 

873
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,510
the index. Now, let's start this game.
Okay, beautiful. Okay, this voting looks

874
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
Okay, beautiful. Okay, this voting looks
 

875
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,430
Okay, beautiful. Okay, this voting looks
good. I just want to make a few tweaks

876
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
good. I just want to make a few tweaks
 

877
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,150
good. I just want to make a few tweaks
here. Let's see about this tier. That

878
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
here. Let's see about this tier. That
 

879
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,830
here. Let's see about this tier. That
looks good, but I want this kind of over

880
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
looks good, but I want this kind of over
 

881
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,789
looks good, but I want this kind of over
here. So, I'm going to do this over here

882
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
here. So, I'm going to do this over here
 

883
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,430
here. So, I'm going to do this over here
so I can edit the properties. And we

884
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
so I can edit the properties. And we
 

885
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,669
so I can edit the properties. And we
have this space between, but I actually

886
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
have this space between, but I actually
 

887
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,470
have this space between, but I actually
want these together. That looks good.

888
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480
want these together. That looks good.
 

889
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,950
want these together. That looks good.
And I want to give them a little space.

890
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
And I want to give them a little space.
 

891
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,549
And I want to give them a little space.
So, maybe 12 pixels. That's too much.

892
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
So, maybe 12 pixels. That's too much.
 

893
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,950
So, maybe 12 pixels. That's too much.
So, let's say six. Yeah, that's looking

894
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
So, let's say six. Yeah, that's looking
 

895
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,630
So, let's say six. Yeah, that's looking
better. and maybe add some room in the

896
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
better. and maybe add some room in the
 

897
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,830
better. and maybe add some room in the
bottom here. So, let's grab this icon

898
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
bottom here. So, let's grab this icon
 

899
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,390
bottom here. So, let's grab this icon
right here. Let's add a modifier, some

900
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
right here. Let's add a modifier, some
 

901
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,510
right here. Let's add a modifier, some
padding. And I don't want all this

902
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
padding. And I don't want all this
 

903
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,390
padding. And I don't want all this
padding. Just add some in over here.

904
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400
padding. Just add some in over here.
 

905
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,710
padding. Just add some in over here.
Maybe six pixels.

906
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
Maybe six pixels.
 

907
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,430
Maybe six pixels.
Maybe some more. Yeah, that looks good.

908
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
Maybe some more. Yeah, that looks good.
 

909
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,789
Maybe some more. Yeah, that looks good.
Okay. Also, I want this button to be a

910
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
Okay. Also, I want this button to be a
 

911
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,350
Okay. Also, I want this button to be a
little bit bigger here. Let me check the

912
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
little bit bigger here. Let me check the
 

913
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,029
little bit bigger here. Let me check the
Now, I don't know where the height is

914
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
Now, I don't know where the height is
 

915
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,270
Now, I don't know where the height is
coming from. So, I'm going to go up in

916
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
coming from. So, I'm going to go up in
 

917
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,710
coming from. So, I'm going to go up in
this hierarchy to see. Oh, we've got a

918
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
this hierarchy to see. Oh, we've got a
 

919
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,870
this hierarchy to see. Oh, we've got a
sized box right here. Oh, and we can

920
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
sized box right here. Oh, and we can
 

921
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,630
sized box right here. Oh, and we can
grab the height right here. So, I'm

922
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
grab the height right here. So, I'm
 

923
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,669
grab the height right here. So, I'm
thinking maybe 50 pixels or 60. Okay.

924
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
thinking maybe 50 pixels or 60. Okay.
 

925
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,830
thinking maybe 50 pixels or 60. Okay.
Yeah, I like that better. All right. So,

926
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840
Yeah, I like that better. All right. So,
 

927
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,590
Yeah, I like that better. All right. So,
let's go through here and good. Not

928
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
let's go through here and good. Not
 

929
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,350
let's go through here and good. Not
great. Banana. It's versatile, but not

930
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
great. Banana. It's versatile, but not
 

931
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,909
great. Banana. It's versatile, but not
too yummy. Okay. I'm here on my last

932
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
too yummy. Okay. I'm here on my last
 

933
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,230
too yummy. Okay. I'm here on my last
fruit and when I click here I get this

934
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
fruit and when I click here I get this
 

935
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,430
fruit and when I click here I get this
missing or insufficient permissions. So

936
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
missing or insufficient permissions. So
 

937
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,390
missing or insufficient permissions. So
I'm going to tell my agent when I'm on

938
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
I'm going to tell my agent when I'm on
 

939
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,789
I'm going to tell my agent when I'm on
my last fruit and click view results I'm

940
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
my last fruit and click view results I'm
 

941
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,789
my last fruit and click view results I'm
getting the fire store error missing or

942
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
getting the fire store error missing or
 

943
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,510
getting the fire store error missing or
insufficient

944
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
insufficient
 

945
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,430
insufficient
permissions. Now it [clears throat]

946
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440
permissions. Now it [clears throat]
 

947
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,870
permissions. Now it [clears throat]
currently doesn't have access to my

948
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
currently doesn't have access to my
 

949
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,470
currently doesn't have access to my
permissions. So, I'm going to go into

950
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
permissions. So, I'm going to go into
 

951
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,549
permissions. So, I'm going to go into
the Firebase console and just paste them

952
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
the Firebase console and just paste them
 

953
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,630
the Firebase console and just paste them
in here. So, I'm in here. I can go to my

954
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
in here. So, I'm in here. I can go to my
 

955
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,270
in here. So, I'm in here. I can go to my
rules. I can just select all of these

956
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
rules. I can just select all of these
 

957
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,149
rules. I can just select all of these
and then paste them in. Okay. So, we the

958
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
and then paste them in. Okay. So, we the
 

959
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,990
and then paste them in. Okay. So, we the
agent recognized the problem here and

960
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
agent recognized the problem here and
 

961
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,390
agent recognized the problem here and
gave me the updated rule for the

962
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,400
gave me the updated rule for the
 

963
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,630
gave me the updated rule for the
rankings. So, I'm going to copy this and

964
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:52,640
rankings. So, I'm going to copy this and
 

965
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,710
rankings. So, I'm going to copy this and
paste that back in and come up and

966
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
paste that back in and come up and
 

967
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,789
paste that back in and come up and
publish. All right. Now, we can view

968
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
publish. All right. Now, we can view
 

969
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,270
publish. All right. Now, we can view
results and we need to create another

970
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
results and we need to create another
 

971
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,190
results and we need to create another
index and we're just going to ask the

972
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,200
index and we're just going to ask the
 

973
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,870
index and we're just going to ask the
agent about this. I'm no no no no longer

974
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
agent about this. I'm no no no no longer
 

975
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,270
agent about this. I'm no no no no longer
getting a permissions error but an error

976
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
getting a permissions error but an error
 

977
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,430
getting a permissions error but an error
that I need to create an index. What

978
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
that I need to create an index. What
 

979
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,510
that I need to create an index. What
index do I need to create? Okay, it's

980
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
index do I need to create? Okay, it's
 

981
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,350
index do I need to create? Okay, it's
telling me this index. So, I'm going to

982
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
telling me this index. So, I'm going to
 

983
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,510
telling me this index. So, I'm going to
go over and create that. And you can do

984
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
go over and create that. And you can do
 

985
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,149
go over and create that. And you can do
that by coming into indexes right here

986
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
that by coming into indexes right here
 

987
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,270
that by coming into indexes right here
and add an index. Okay, that's done. And

988
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,280
and add an index. Okay, that's done. And
 

989
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,710
and add an index. Okay, that's done. And
it'll take a minute to build that index.

990
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
it'll take a minute to build that index.
 

991
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,950
it'll take a minute to build that index.
Okay, so that's all done. The index is

992
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
Okay, so that's all done. The index is
 

993
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,830
Okay, so that's all done. The index is
made. So let's view our results. And

994
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840
made. So let's view our results. And
 

995
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,669
made. So let's view our results. And
beautiful. So we get our session ID,

996
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
beautiful. So we get our session ID,
 

997
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,230
beautiful. So we get our session ID,
which we need. And now we just have to

998
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
which we need. And now we just have to
 

999
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,029
which we need. And now we just have to
design this page. So let's give that to

1000
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
design this page. So let's give that to
 

1001
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,630
design this page. So let's give that to
our agent. So we're going to open up a

1002
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:46,640
our agent. So we're going to open up a
 

1003
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,270
our agent. So we're going to open up a
new conversation thread here. And we're

1004
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
new conversation thread here. And we're
 

1005
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,350
new conversation thread here. And we're
going to say create the results page.

1006
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
going to say create the results page.
 

1007
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,909
going to say create the results page.
Make sure to include the tier rankings

1008

and comments. This will be used for both

1010
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
and comments. This will be used for both
 

1011
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,310
and comments. This will be used for both
the global game as well as the game with

1012
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
the global game as well as the game with
 

1013
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,270
the global game as well as the game with
the room code. Follow up with questions

1014
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,280
the room code. Follow up with questions
 

1015
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,950
the room code. Follow up with questions
before you proceed to reduce ambiguity.

1016
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:18,960
before you proceed to reduce ambiguity.
 

1017
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,110
before you proceed to reduce ambiguity.
And not unsurprisingly, we get some

1018
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
And not unsurprisingly, we get some
 

1019
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,029

1025
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,430
uh the ability to see these
leaderboards. So, we're going to say on

1026
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:29,440
leaderboards. So, we're going to say on
 

1027
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,470
leaderboards. So, we're going to say on
the homepage if the user has completed

1028
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
the homepage if the user has completed
 

1029
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,830
the homepage if the user has completed
the global game, create a button for the

And I'm going to go into the code. And

1040
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
And I'm going to go into the code. And
 

1041
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,789
