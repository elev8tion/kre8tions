1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,990

Dreamflow just got an update. So let me

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,000
Dreamflow just got an update. So let me
 

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,669
Dreamflow just got an update. So let me
show you some of the features. The first

4
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
show you some of the features. The first
 

5
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,710
show you some of the features. The first
one is Superbase edge functions. So now

6
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720
one is Superbase edge functions. So now
 

7
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,270
one is Superbase edge functions. So now
you can write and deploy Superbase edge

8
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
you can write and deploy Superbase edge
 

9
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,350
you can write and deploy Superbase edge
functions right from Dreamflow. So let

10
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
functions right from Dreamflow. So let
 

11
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,629
functions right from Dreamflow. So let
me show you how this works. So I've

12
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:12,639
me show you how this works. So I've
 

13
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,230
me show you how this works. So I've
already got a Superbase project

14
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
already got a Superbase project
 

15
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,990
already got a Superbase project
connected here. And if I scroll down,

16
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
connected here. And if I scroll down,
 

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,990
connected here. And if I scroll down,
you can see I've got this edge functions

18
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
you can see I've got this edge functions
 

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,230
you can see I've got this edge functions
section. So I can come in and create an

20
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
section. So I can come in and create an
 

21
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,070
section. So I can come in and create an
edge function. And it's going to pop me

22
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
edge function. And it's going to pop me
 

23
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,390
edge function. And it's going to pop me
over to the agent because the agent has

24
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
over to the agent because the agent has
 

25
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,630
over to the agent because the agent has
these capabilities. And so it says,

26
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
these capabilities. And so it says,
 

27
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,630
these capabilities. And so it says,
"Please generate a superbase edge

28
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
"Please generate a superbase edge
 

29
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,549
"Please generate a superbase edge
function that is a proxy service for

30
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
function that is a proxy service for
 

31
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,430
function that is a proxy service for
open AI." Okay, great. So our agent has

32
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
open AI." Okay, great. So our agent has
 

33
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,670
open AI." Okay, great. So our agent has
written these Typescript files. If you

34
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
written these Typescript files. If you
 

35
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,510
written these Typescript files. If you
want to go see them, you can just click

36
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
want to go see them, you can just click
 

37
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,229
want to go see them, you can just click
into this view code right here and it'll

38
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
into this view code right here and it'll
 

39
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,389
into this view code right here and it'll
open up the actual function. And you can

40
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
open up the actual function. And you can
 

41
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,830
open up the actual function. And you can
see another great feature that we've

42
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
see another great feature that we've
 

43
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,069
see another great feature that we've
released is secrets. So the agent

44
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
released is secrets. So the agent
 

45
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,389
released is secrets. So the agent
recognized that we need some secure

46
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
recognized that we need some secure
 

47
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,869
recognized that we need some secure
secrets here like our open AI key

48
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
secrets here like our open AI key
 

49
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,750
secrets here like our open AI key
allowed origins and base URL. So it's

50
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
allowed origins and base URL. So it's
 

51
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,830
allowed origins and base URL. So it's
propagated this secrets feature right

52
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:57,840
propagated this secrets feature right
 

53
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,630
propagated this secrets feature right
here. So if I come in here and edit

54
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
here. So if I come in here and edit
 

55
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,430
here. So if I come in here and edit
this, let's put in our value and accept

56
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
this, let's put in our value and accept
 

57
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,990
this, let's put in our value and accept
it. Now that's deployed in Superbase.

58
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
it. Now that's deployed in Superbase.
 

59
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,070
it. Now that's deployed in Superbase.
Now our function isn't deployed yet. For

60
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
Now our function isn't deployed yet. For
 

61
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,070
Now our function isn't deployed yet. For
safety and security reasons, the agent

62
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
safety and security reasons, the agent
 

63
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,990
safety and security reasons, the agent
won't deploy these for you so that you

64
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
won't deploy these for you so that you
 

65
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,750
won't deploy these for you so that you
can review the code before you deploy.

66
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
can review the code before you deploy.
 

67
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,350
can review the code before you deploy.
Now, if you have multiple edge functions

68
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
Now, if you have multiple edge functions
 

69
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,030
Now, if you have multiple edge functions
here, you can deploy them individually

70
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
here, you can deploy them individually
 

71
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,190
here, you can deploy them individually
using this button right here, or deploy

72
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
using this button right here, or deploy
 

73
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,230
using this button right here, or deploy
all of them right here. Awesome. And now

74
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
all of them right here. Awesome. And now
 

75
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,149
all of them right here. Awesome. And now
that's deployed. And because your agent

76
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
that's deployed. And because your agent
 

77
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,670
that's deployed. And because your agent
knows about this, it'll be able to

78
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
knows about this, it'll be able to
 

79
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,350
knows about this, it'll be able to
design the architecture of your app

80
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
design the architecture of your app
 

81
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,190
design the architecture of your app
around these services that you've set

82
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
around these services that you've set
 

83
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,030
around these services that you've set
up. Next, we've increased the character

84
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
up. Next, we've increased the character
 

85
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,749
up. Next, we've increased the character
input max length to your agent. So,

86
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
input max length to your agent. So,
 

87
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,990
input max length to your agent. So,
previously it was at 10,000 characters.

88
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
previously it was at 10,000 characters.
 

89
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,230
previously it was at 10,000 characters.
Now, it's 50,000. This means that if

90
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
Now, it's 50,000. This means that if
 

91
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,109
Now, it's 50,000. This means that if
you've got a larger PRD or spec document

92
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119
you've got a larger PRD or spec document
 

93
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,870
you've got a larger PRD or spec document
that you want to pass to your agent or

94
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
that you want to pass to your agent or
 

95
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,550
that you want to pass to your agent or
maybe pass some documentation for a

96
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
maybe pass some documentation for a
 

97
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,990
maybe pass some documentation for a
library that you're using, you're able

98
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
library that you're using, you're able
 

99
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,230
library that you're using, you're able
to add much greater context. So there's

100
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
to add much greater context. So there's
 

101
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,630
to add much greater context. So there's
this new package swift animations that I

102
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
this new package swift animations that I
 

103
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,469
this new package swift animations that I
wanted to use. But because it's a new

104
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
wanted to use. But because it's a new
 

105
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,149
wanted to use. But because it's a new
package, the agent had trouble

106
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
package, the agent had trouble
 

107
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,230
package, the agent had trouble
integrating it into my app. So instead,

108
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
integrating it into my app. So instead,
 

109
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,550
integrating it into my app. So instead,
I use this service get ingest to grab

110
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
I use this service get ingest to grab
 

111
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,630
I use this service get ingest to grab
the documentation. So then my agent was

112
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
the documentation. So then my agent was
 

113
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,709
the documentation. So then my agent was
better able to understand the API and

114
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
better able to understand the API and
 

115
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,709
better able to understand the API and
integrate it into my project. Finally,

116
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
integrate it into my project. Finally,
 

117
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,030
integrate it into my project. Finally,
the speed of the agent has drastically

118
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
the speed of the agent has drastically
 

119
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,510
the speed of the agent has drastically
improved. So, you should see much faster

120
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
improved. So, you should see much faster
 

121
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,350
improved. So, you should see much faster
performance with the same quality out of

122
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
performance with the same quality out of
 

123
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,030
performance with the same quality out of
the agent in Dreamflow. Those are the

124
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
the agent in Dreamflow. Those are the
 

125
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,550
the agent in Dreamflow. Those are the
updates this week. Let us know if you

126
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
updates this week. Let us know if you
 

127
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,750
updates this week. Let us know if you
have any questions and we'll see you in

128
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
