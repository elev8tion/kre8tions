Dreamflow is the best place to build and

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:02,159
Dreamflow is the best place to build and
 

3
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,550
Dreamflow is the best place to build and
ship cross-platform applications. So,

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:04,560
ship cross-platform applications. So,
 

5
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,230
ship cross-platform applications. So,
let me show you around. You can start a

6
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240
let me show you around. You can start a
 

7
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,790
let me show you around. You can start a
project with a prompt, a template, or a

8
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:08,800
project with a prompt, a template, or a
 

9
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,230
project with a prompt, a template, or a
blank project. And that's what we're

10
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
blank project. And that's what we're
 

11
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,070
blank project. And that's what we're
going to do. When Dreamflow opens up,

12
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
going to do. When Dreamflow opens up,
 

13
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,230
going to do. When Dreamflow opens up,
there are four main areas. The preview

I want to come in here and edit the
 

35
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,549
I want to come in here and edit the
properties, I can do that. The fourth

36
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
properties, I can do that. The fourth
 

37
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,950
properties, I can do that. The fourth
section is over here with your agent.

Let's close this up. And we've got some

40
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
Let's close this up. And we've got some
 

41
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,950
Let's close this up. And we've got some
app ideas that the agent gives you. Or

42
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
app ideas that the agent gives you. Or
 

43
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,470
app ideas that the agent gives you. Or
if you're opening a project, you'll see

44
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
if you're opening a project, you'll see
 

45
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,389
if you're opening a project, you'll see
some next steps, but we already have a

46
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
some next steps, but we already have a
 

47
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,310
some next steps, but we already have a
plan, so we're going to toggle this off.

48
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
plan, so we're going to toggle this off.
 

49
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,229
plan, so we're going to toggle this off.
I went over to Dribble and found the

50
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
I went over to Dribble and found the
 

51
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,790
I went over to Dribble and found the
most popular UI of all time. Let's see

52
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
most popular UI of all time. Let's see
 

53
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,869
most popular UI of all time. Let's see
how Dreamflow does at building this. So,

54
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
how Dreamflow does at building this. So,
 

55
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,950
how Dreamflow does at building this. So,
I'm going to drop that image in here and

56
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
I'm going to drop that image in here and
 

57
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,150
I'm going to drop that image in here and
select GPT5 and tell the agent create

58
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
select GPT5 and tell the agent create
 

59
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,149
select GPT5 and tell the agent create
this component. Focus on visual

60
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
this component. Focus on visual
 

61
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,910
this component. Focus on visual
fidelity. The agent is going to

62
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
fidelity. The agent is going to
 

63
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,070
fidelity. The agent is going to
understand the image, our prompt, look

64
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
understand the image, our prompt, look
 

65
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,149
understand the image, our prompt, look
through the project, make a plan, and

66
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
through the project, make a plan, and
 

67
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,310
through the project, make a plan, and
execute it. All right, this is looking

68
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320

73
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,789
buttons to be the same size. So, I'm
going to go into inspect mode here,

74
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
going to go into inspect mode here,
 

75

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
it to make the cancel button the same
 

85
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,870
it to make the cancel button the same
height as the create button. That's

86
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
height as the create button. That's
 

87
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,350

Beautiful. Okay. Next, let's ask our
 

101
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,429
Beautiful. Okay. Next, let's ask our
agent to create a color palette and some

102
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
agent to create a color palette and some
 

103
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,910
agent to create a color palette and some
theming based on this. create color

104

Great. So, we can see this color theme

108
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
Great. So, we can see this color theme
 

109
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,190
Great. So, we can see this color theme
right here. If we go into our theme

110
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
right here. If we go into our theme
 

111
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,510
right here. If we go into our theme
settings, we've got our typography and

112
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
settings, we've got our typography and
 

113
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,830

115
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,590
our style constants right here. So, if
we go in and make a change to one of

116
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
we go in and make a change to one of
 

117
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,190
we go in and make a change to one of
these right here, we can see it

these right here, we can see it
 

119
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,430
these right here, we can see it
propagate throughout the app. Great. But

120
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
propagate throughout the app. Great. But
 

121
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,270
propagate throughout the app. Great. But
I'm going to push that back for now. And

122
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
I'm going to push that back for now. And
 

123
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,190
I'm going to push that back for now. And
let's create a page for all the events

124
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
let's create a page for all the events
 

125
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,589
let's create a page for all the events
you create. Okay, this looks great.

126
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
you create. Okay, this looks great.
 

127
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,510

Let's create a new event here.

128
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
Let's create a new event here.
 

129
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,990
Let's create a new event here.
Beautiful. Next, let's add a logo. But I

130
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
Beautiful. Next, let's add a logo. But I
 

131
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,229
Beautiful. Next, let's add a logo. But I
wanted an SVG and so I want to use this

132
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
wanted an SVG and so I want to use this
 

133
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,790
wanted an SVG and so I want to use this
package on PubDev, a package repository

134
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
package on PubDev, a package repository
 

135
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,350
package on PubDev, a package repository
with over 50,000 packages. So I'm just

136
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
with over 50,000 packages. So I'm just
 

137
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,949
with over 50,000 packages. So I'm just
going to copy this right here and tell

138
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
going to copy this right here and tell
 

139

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
package. Okay, there it is. There's just
 

143
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,990
package. Okay, there it is. There's just
a placeholder there. Let's replace that

144
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
a placeholder there. Let's replace that
 

145
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,350
a placeholder there. Let's replace that
by adding our SVG asset here. So I can

146
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
by adding our SVG asset here. So I can
 

147
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,270
by adding our SVG asset here. So I can
add it in here or just drag and drop it

148
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
add it in here or just drag and drop it
 

149
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,030
add it in here or just drag and drop it

151
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,630
in. Great. We've added it in there. And
if we want to see it in the code, we can

152
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
if we want to see it in the code, we can
 

153
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,390
if we want to see it in the code, we can
jump into the code here. Go into our

154

167
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,670
constructor, which will be an asset. And
let's grab a path to our image right

168
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
let's grab a path to our image right
 

169
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,030
let's grab a path to our image right
there. Let's rightclick, copy path, and

170

there. Let's rightclick, copy path, and
 

171
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,509
there. Let's rightclick, copy path, and
paste it in. Beautiful. Next, let's wire

172
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
paste it in. Beautiful. Next, let's wire
 

173
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,589
paste it in. Beautiful. Next, let's wire
this up to a backend so our data can

174
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
this up to a backend so our data can
 

175
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,830
this up to a backend so our data can
persist. And we've got Superbase and

176
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
persist. And we've got Superbase and
 

177
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,350
persist. And we've got Superbase and
Firebase. and I'm going to connect to

178
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
Firebase. and I'm going to connect to
 

179
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,509
Firebase. and I'm going to connect to
Firebase. Create a new project and

180
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
Firebase. Create a new project and
 

181
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,670
Firebase. Create a new project and
configure Firebase. Generate the client

182
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
configure Firebase. Generate the client
 

183
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,309
configure Firebase. Generate the client
code. Okay, great. I added an on signin

184
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
code. Okay, great. I added an on signin
 

185
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,550
code. Okay, great. I added an on signin
in Firebase. And so we can go in now.

186
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
in Firebase. And so we can go in now.
 

187
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,110
in Firebase. And so we can go in now.
Now let's add an event.

188
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
Now let's add an event.
 

189
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,509
Now let's add an event.
Beautiful. Last thing to do is to deploy

190
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
Beautiful. Last thing to do is to deploy
 

191
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,190
Beautiful. Last thing to do is to deploy
our app. And you can do that with one

192
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
our app. And you can do that with one
 

193
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,990
our app. And you can do that with one
click to the web, iOS, and Android. We

click to the web, iOS, and Android. We
 

195
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,350
click to the web, iOS, and Android. We
can't wait to see what you'll build in

196
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
can't wait to see what you'll build in
 

197
