00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,070

In this video, I want to show you how to

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,080
In this video, I want to show you how to
 

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,390
In this video, I want to show you how to
organize your panels in DreamFlow to

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
organize your panels in DreamFlow to
 

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,789
organize your panels in DreamFlow to
create the most efficient workspace for

6
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799
create the most efficient workspace for
 

7
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,430
create the most efficient workspace for
your needs. Now, this idea is actually

8
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
your needs. Now, this idea is actually
 

9
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,990
your needs. Now, this idea is actually
central to our design philosophy of

10
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
central to our design philosophy of
 

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,190
central to our design philosophy of
Dreamflow itself because we believe that

12
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
Dreamflow itself because we believe that
 

13
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,670
Dreamflow itself because we believe that
every modern developer should have three

14
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
every modern developer should have three
 

15
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,790
every modern developer should have three
types of tools or surfaces readily

16
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
types of tools or surfaces readily
 

17
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,310
types of tools or surfaces readily
available. A code editor, a visual

18
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
available. A code editor, a visual
 

19
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,589
available. A code editor, a visual
interface, and an AI prompt for an AI

20
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
interface, and an AI prompt for an AI
 

21
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,790
interface, and an AI prompt for an AI
agent. Now, depending on the task and

22
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
agent. Now, depending on the task and
 

23
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,709
agent. Now, depending on the task and
your preferences, you may want to

24
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
your preferences, you may want to
 

25
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,110
your preferences, you may want to
interact directly with the code or work

26
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
interact directly with the code or work
 

27
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,910
interact directly with the code or work
with a visual properties panel or select

28
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
with a visual properties panel or select
 

29
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,150
with a visual properties panel or select
widgets from your app itself to be able

30
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
widgets from your app itself to be able
 

31
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,630
widgets from your app itself to be able
to change them or to chat with an AI

32
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
to change them or to chat with an AI
 

33
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,990
to change them or to chat with an AI
agent to make the changes itself. So, we

34
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
agent to make the changes itself. So, we
 

35
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,229
agent to make the changes itself. So, we
designed Dreamflow not only to provide

36
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
designed Dreamflow not only to provide
 

37
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,389
designed Dreamflow not only to provide
these three surfaces, but also to give

38
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
these three surfaces, but also to give
 

39
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,950
these three surfaces, but also to give
you the freedom to show and hide them

40
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
you the freedom to show and hide them
 

41
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,189
you the freedom to show and hide them
based on what you're working on. So,

42
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
based on what you're working on. So,
 

43
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,910
based on what you're working on. So,
let's jump in and check this out. So

44
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
let's jump in and check this out. So
 

45
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,150
let's jump in and check this out. So
when you jump into DreamFlow, you're

46
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
when you jump into DreamFlow, you're
 

47
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,910
when you jump into DreamFlow, you're
going to see something like this

48
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
going to see something like this
 

49
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,990
going to see something like this
interface right here. Now there are two

50
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
interface right here. Now there are two
 

51
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,190
interface right here. Now there are two
main ways to show and hide different

52
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
main ways to show and hide different
 

53
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,350
main ways to show and hide different
surfaces depending on what you need. So

54
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
surfaces depending on what you need. So
 

55
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,510
surfaces depending on what you need. So
the first way is up here with these

56
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
the first way is up here with these
 

57
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,109
the first way is up here with these
three options. So if I toggle this one,

58
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
three options. So if I toggle this one,
 

59
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,990
three options. So if I toggle this one,
this will show this module or widget

60
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
this will show this module or widget
 

61
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,469
this will show this module or widget
tree option over here. Now, if you have

62
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
tree option over here. Now, if you have
 

63
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,030
tree option over here. Now, if you have
other modules open like a Firebase or a

64
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
other modules open like a Firebase or a
 

65
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,950
other modules open like a Firebase or a
Superbase or your assets panel right

66
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
Superbase or your assets panel right
 

67
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,070
Superbase or your assets panel right
here, this will collapse that as well.

68
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
here, this will collapse that as well.
 

69
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,749
here, this will collapse that as well.
But most often, you're going to have

70
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
But most often, you're going to have
 

71
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,950
But most often, you're going to have
this widget tree panel open. Okay. The

72
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
this widget tree panel open. Okay. The
 

73
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,630
this widget tree panel open. Okay. The
second one is your properties panel. So,

74
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
second one is your properties panel. So,
 

75
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,030
second one is your properties panel. So,
this is contextual. So, whatever widget

76
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
this is contextual. So, whatever widget
 

77
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,109
this is contextual. So, whatever widget
you have selected, you'll see the

78
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119
you have selected, you'll see the
 

79
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,830
you have selected, you'll see the
properties of that widget populate here.

80
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
properties of that widget populate here.
 

81
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,230
properties of that widget populate here.
And then finally, this third option, you

82
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
And then finally, this third option, you
 

83
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,429
And then finally, this third option, you
have your AI agent panel. Now to show or

84
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
have your AI agent panel. Now to show or
 

85
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,030
have your AI agent panel. Now to show or
hide these of course you can just click

86
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
hide these of course you can just click
 

87
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,590
hide these of course you can just click
these on or off. We also have shortcut

88
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
these on or off. We also have shortcut
 

89
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,950
these on or off. We also have shortcut
keys. So you have option two, three and

90
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
keys. So you have option two, three and
 

91
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,310
keys. So you have option two, three and
four to open and close these. So that's

92
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
four to open and close these. So that's
 

93
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,389
four to open and close these. So that's
the first way. The second way is to open

94
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
the first way. The second way is to open
 

95
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,709
the first way. The second way is to open
and close them with options within the

96
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
and close them with options within the
 

97
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,870
and close them with options within the
panel itself. So you've got these X

98
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
panel itself. So you've got these X
 

99
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,350
panel itself. So you've got these X
marks right here just as you would

100
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
marks right here just as you would
 

101
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,750
marks right here just as you would
expect. But also when they're closed you

102
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
expect. But also when they're closed you
 

103
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,910
expect. But also when they're closed you
can see that you've got these bars right

104
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
can see that you've got these bars right
 

105
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,070
can see that you've got these bars right
here that you can just click to open

106
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
here that you can just click to open
 

107
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,510
here that you can just click to open
them just like that. So if you want one

108
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
them just like that. So if you want one
 

109
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,150
them just like that. So if you want one
or two or all three open, you can just

110
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
or two or all three open, you can just
 

111
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,990
or two or all three open, you can just
toggle them however you want. Okay. So

112
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
toggle them however you want. Okay. So
 

113
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,309
toggle them however you want. Okay. So
those are the sort of two main ways to

114
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
those are the sort of two main ways to
 

115
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,190
those are the sort of two main ways to
manage your panels. But in this code

116
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
manage your panels. But in this code
 

117
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,910
manage your panels. But in this code
view right here, there's some additional

118
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
view right here, there's some additional
 

119
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,630
view right here, there's some additional
options you have. So right now I'm just

120
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
options you have. So right now I'm just
 

121
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,229
options you have. So right now I'm just
going to keep everything collapsed like

122
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
going to keep everything collapsed like
 

123
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,350
going to keep everything collapsed like
that. And I want to open up code view

124
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
that. And I want to open up code view
 

125
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,990
that. And I want to open up code view
right here. And you'll probably see

126
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
right here. And you'll probably see
 

127
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,470
right here. And you'll probably see
something like this. So you'll have your

128
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
something like this. So you'll have your
 

129
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,110
something like this. So you'll have your
files and folders, your file explorer

130
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
files and folders, your file explorer
 

131
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,350
files and folders, your file explorer
view right here, and then you'll have

132
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
view right here, and then you'll have
 

133
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,750
view right here, and then you'll have
the actual code of whatever file you

134
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
the actual code of whatever file you
 

135
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,750
the actual code of whatever file you
have open on the right. Now, I find

136
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
have open on the right. Now, I find
 

137
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,750
have open on the right. Now, I find
myself most often wanting to see a

138
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
myself most often wanting to see a
 

139
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,390
myself most often wanting to see a
preview of the app and my code at once.

140
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
preview of the app and my code at once.
 

141
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,550
preview of the app and my code at once.
And that's where this split option comes

142
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
And that's where this split option comes
 

143
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,869
And that's where this split option comes
in right here. That is, it's split

144
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
in right here. That is, it's split
 

145
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,350
in right here. That is, it's split
between my code view over here on the

146
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
between my code view over here on the
 

147
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,470
between my code view over here on the
left and the preview over here. Now, if

148
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
left and the preview over here. Now, if
 

149
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,910
left and the preview over here. Now, if
you want your preview on the left and

150
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
you want your preview on the left and
 

151
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,509
you want your preview on the left and
your code on the right, that's what this

152
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
your code on the right, that's what this
 

153
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,910
your code on the right, that's what this
button is here for. And so, you can just

154
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
button is here for. And so, you can just
 

155
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,110
button is here for. And so, you can just
swap those. Now, most of the time, what

156
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
swap those. Now, most of the time, what
 

157
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,509
swap those. Now, most of the time, what
you're going to want is the preview and

158
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
you're going to want is the preview and
 

159
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,589
you're going to want is the preview and
the actual code that you're going to be

160
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
the actual code that you're going to be
 

161
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,190
the actual code that you're going to be
working on most of the time, and then

162
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
working on most of the time, and then
 

163
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,430
working on most of the time, and then
you just switch between files. So, that

164
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
you just switch between files. So, that
 

165
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,229
you just switch between files. So, that
is to say, you don't need this visual

166
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
is to say, you don't need this visual
 

167
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,630
is to say, you don't need this visual
space of your file explorer. So, you can

168
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
space of your file explorer. So, you can
 

169
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,869
space of your file explorer. So, you can
just close that up right there. And

170
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
just close that up right there. And
 

171
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,630
just close that up right there. And
then, if you want to change the space

172
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
then, if you want to change the space
 

173
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,229
then, if you want to change the space
between these, you can just pull those.

174
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
between these, you can just pull those.
 

175
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,470
between these, you can just pull those.
And that works on any of these files. So

176
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
And that works on any of these files. So
 

177
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,309
And that works on any of these files. So
maybe I want to have my agent open. So

178
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
maybe I want to have my agent open. So
 

179
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,550
maybe I want to have my agent open. So
I've got my preview, I've got my code,

180
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
I've got my preview, I've got my code,
 

181
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,789
I've got my preview, I've got my code,
and then I've got my agent. And you can

182
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
and then I've got my agent. And you can
 

183
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,710
and then I've got my agent. And you can
adjust the difference like that. Okay.

184
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
adjust the difference like that. Okay.
 

185
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,789
adjust the difference like that. Okay.
So that's your code view. But remember,

186
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
So that's your code view. But remember,
 

187
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,190
So that's your code view. But remember,
when you're in this nested code view, so

188
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
when you're in this nested code view, so
 

189
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,630
when you're in this nested code view, so
you can have your code here. You can

190
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
you can have your code here. You can
 

191
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,030
you can have your code here. You can
have your split view. You can have your

192
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
have your split view. You can have your
 

193
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,350
have your split view. You can have your
files open up just like that. Of course,

194
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
files open up just like that. Of course,
 

195
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,190
files open up just like that. Of course,
you can combine that with any of these

196
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
you can combine that with any of these
 

197
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,910
you can combine that with any of these
up here. So if I open it up like that,

198
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
up here. So if I open it up like that,
 

199
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,789
up here. So if I open it up like that,
now I have my widget tree. Let's scale

200
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
now I have my widget tree. Let's scale
 

201
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,710
now I have my widget tree. Let's scale
this down so it's not budging up against

202
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
this down so it's not budging up against
 

203
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,030
this down so it's not budging up against
the edges. You can change the size of

204
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
the edges. You can change the size of
 

205
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,949
the edges. You can change the size of
your widget tree like that. Now, of

206
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
your widget tree like that. Now, of
 

207
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,710
your widget tree like that. Now, of
course, I'm having trouble seeing my

208
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
course, I'm having trouble seeing my
 

209
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,629
course, I'm having trouble seeing my
code right here. So, I can collapse my

210
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
code right here. So, I can collapse my
 

211
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,189
code right here. So, I can collapse my
file tree right there. And that works

212
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
file tree right there. And that works
 

213
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,670
file tree right there. And that works
great. So, that's how to manage your

214
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
great. So, that's how to manage your
 

215
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,990
great. So, that's how to manage your
workspace. So, you can make it efficient

216
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
workspace. So, you can make it efficient
 

217
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,550
workspace. So, you can make it efficient
and tailor it to whatever needs and

218
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
and tailor it to whatever needs and
 

219
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,189
and tailor it to whatever needs and

there's a bug or a feature request or if
there's another style of working that

228
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
there's another style of working that
 

229
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,670
there's another style of working that
you would like to see in DreamFlow, we'd
