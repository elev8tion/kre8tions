            ### Build Performance
            - **Build Time**: ${buildTime} seconds
            - **Target**: < 180 seconds (3 minutes)

            ### Performance Tasks Status

            #### Short-term (2-4 weeks):
            - [ ] Add performance benchmarks for code analysis on large files (10k+ lines)
            - [ ] Test UI responsiveness with 500+ widgets in preview
            - [ ] Implement memory profiling during project lifecycle
            - [ ] Set up regression testing for performance

            #### Long-term (2-3 months):
            - [ ] Profile code analysis performance
            - [ ] Optimize widget rendering pipeline
            - [ ] Implement lazy loading for large projects
            - [ ] Add performance monitoring dashboard

            ### Next Steps
            1. Implement dedicated performance test suite
            2. Set up continuous performance monitoring
            3. Establish performance budgets

            ### Missing Test Coverage:

            #### Immediate (This Week):
            - [ ] Service failure tests for stability
            - [ ] Error recovery scenarios
            - [ ] Edge case handling

            #### Short-term (2-4 weeks):
            - [ ] Integration tests for error scenarios (invalid ZIP, corrupt projects)
            - [ ] Performance tests (large files 10k+ lines)
            - [ ] UI responsiveness tests (500+ widgets)
            - [ ] Memory profiling tests
            - [ ] Persistence layer fallback tests

            #### Long-term (2-3 months):
            - [ ] Real-time collaboration tests
            - [ ] Concurrent editing conflict tests
            - [ ] WebSocket fallback tests
            - [ ] Load testing with large projects (1000+ files)

            ### Recommendations:
            1. Focus on service failure tests first (critical for stability)
            2. Add performance regression tests
            3. Mock external API calls thoroughly
            4. Test browser API abstractions
